PENELOPE IN SWITZERLAND</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">A DAY IN PESTALOZZI-TOWN</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Salemina</span> and I were in
Geneva.&nbsp; If you had ever travelled through Europe with a
charming spinster who never sat down at a Continental <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> without being asked by an American
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> whether she were one of the P.&rsquo;s of
Salem, Massachusetts, you would understand why I call my friend
Salemina.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t mind it.&nbsp; She knows that I
am simply jealous because I came from a vulgarly large tribe that
never had any coat-of-arms, and whose ancestors always sealed
their letters with their thumb nails.</p>
<p>Whenever Francesca and I call her &ldquo;Salemina,&rdquo; she
knows, and we know that she knows, that we are seeing a group of
noble ancestors in a sort of halo over her serene and dignified
head, so she remains unruffled under her <i>petit nom</i>,
inasmuch as the casual public comprehends nothing of its spurious
origin and thinks it was given her by her sponsors in
baptism.</p>
<p>Francesca, Salemina, and I have very different
backgrounds.&nbsp; The first-named is an extremely pretty person
of large income who is travelling with us simply because her
relatives think that she will &ldquo;see Europe&rdquo; more
advantageously under our chaperonage than if she were accompanied
by persons of her own age or &ldquo;set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salemina is a philanthropist and educator of the first rank,
and is collecting all sorts of valuable material to put at the
service of her own country when she returns to it, which will not
be a moment before her letter of credit is exhausted.</p>
<p>I, too, am quasi-educational, for I had a few years of
experience in mothering and teaching little waifs and strays of
the streets before I began to paint pictures.&nbsp; Never shall I
regret those nerve-racking, back-breaking, heart-warming, weary,
and beautiful years, when, all unconsciously, I was learning to
paint children by living with them.&nbsp; Even now the spell
still works and it is the curly head, the &ldquo;shining morning
face,&rdquo; the ready tear, the glancing smile of childhood that
enchains me and gives my brush whatever skill it possesses.</p>
<p>We had not been especially high-minded or educational in
Switzerland, Salemina and I.&nbsp; The worm will turn; and there
is a point where the improvement of one&rsquo;s mind seems a
farce, and the service of humanity, for the moment, a duty only
born of a diseased imagination.</p>
<p>How can one sit on a vine-embowered balcony facing lovely Lake
Geneva and think about modern problems,&mdash;Improved Tenements,
Child Labour, Single Tax, Sweat Shops, and the Right Training of
the Rising Civilization?&nbsp; Blue Lake Geneva!&mdash;blue as a
woman&rsquo;s eye, blue as the vault of heaven, dropped into the
lap of the green earth like a great sparkling sapphire!&nbsp;
Mont Blanc you know to be just behind the clouds on the other
side, and that presently, after hours or days of patient waiting,
he may condescend to unveil himself to your worshipful gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is wise in his dignity and reserve,&rdquo; mused
Salemina as we sat on the veranda.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is all the
more sublime because he withdraws himself from time to
time.&nbsp; In fact, if he didn&rsquo;t see fit to cover himself
occasionally, one could neither eat nor sleep, nor do anything
but adore and magnify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day before this interview we had sailed to the end of the
sapphire lake and visited the &ldquo;snow-white
battlements&rdquo; of the Castle of Chillon; seen its
&ldquo;seven pillars of Gothic mould,&rdquo; and its dungeons
deep and old, where poor Bonnivard, Byron&rsquo;s famous
&ldquo;Prisoner of Chillon,&rdquo; lay captive for so many years,
and where Rousseau fixes the catastrophe of his
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se.</p>
<p>We had just been to Coppet too; Coppet where the Neckers lived
and Madame de Sta&euml;l was born and lived during many years of
her life.&nbsp; We had wandered through the shaded walks of the
magnificent ch&acirc;teau garden, and strolled along the terrace
where the eloquent Corinne had walked with the Schlegels and
other famous <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of her salon.&nbsp; We had
visited Calvin&rsquo;s house at 11 Rue des Chanoines,
Rousseau&rsquo;s at No. 40 on the Grande Rue, and
Voltaire&rsquo;s at Ferney.</p>
<p>And so we had been living the past, Salemina and I.&nbsp;
But</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Early one morning,<br />
Just as the day was dawning.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>my slumbering conscience rose in Puritan strength and asserted
its rights to a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salemina,&rdquo; said I, as I walked into her room,
&ldquo;this life that we are leading will not do for me any
longer.&nbsp; I have been too much immersed in ruins.&nbsp; Last
night in writing to a friend in New York I uttered the most
disloyal and incendiary statements.&nbsp; I said that I would
rather die than live without ruins of some kind; that America was
so new, and crude, and spick and span, that it was obnoxious to
any &aelig;sthetic soul; that our tendency to erect hideous
public buildings and then keep them in repair afterwards would
make us the butt of ridicule among future generations.&nbsp; I
even proposed the founding of an American Ruin Company,
Limited,&mdash;in which the stockholders should purchase
favourably situated bits of land and erect picturesque ruins
thereon.&nbsp; To be sure, I said, these ruins wouldn&rsquo;t
have any associations at first, but what of that?&nbsp; We have
plenty of poets and romancers; we could manufacture suitable
associations and fit them to the premises.&nbsp; At first, it is
true, they might not fire the imagination; but after a few
hundred years, in being crooned by mother to infant and handed
down by father to son, they would mellow with age, as all legends
do, and they would end by being hallowed by rising
generations.&nbsp; I do not say they would be absolutely
satisfactory from every standpoint, but I do say that they would
be better than nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;all this was last
night, and I have had a change of heart this morning.&nbsp; Just
on the borderland between sleeping and waking, I had a
vision.&nbsp; I remembered that to-day would be Monday the 1st of
September; that all over our beloved land schools would be
opening and that your sister pedagogues would be doing your work
for you in your absence.&nbsp; Also I remembered that I am the
dishonourable but Honorary President of a Froebel Society of four
hundred members, that it meets to-morrow, and that I can&rsquo;t
afford to send them a cable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all true,&rdquo; said Salemina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
might have been said more briefly, but it is quite
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, I am only a painter with an occasional
excursion into educational fields, but you ought to be gathering
stories of knowledge to lay at the feet of the masculine members
of your School Board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought, indeed!&rdquo; sighed Salemina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us begin!&rdquo; I urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want
to be good to-day and you must be good with me.&nbsp; I never can
be good alone and neither can you, and you know it.&nbsp; We will
give up the lovely drive in the diligence; the luncheon at the
French restaurant and those heavenly little Swiss cakes&rdquo;
(here Salemina was almost unmanned); &ldquo;the concert on the
great organ and all the other frivolous things we had intended;
and we will make an educational pilgrimage to Yverdon.&nbsp; You
may not remember, my dear,&rdquo;&mdash;this was said severely
because I saw that she meditated rebellion and was going to
refuse any programme which didn&rsquo;t include the Swiss
cakes,&mdash;&ldquo;you may not remember that Jean Henri
Pestalozzi lived and taught in Yverdon.&nbsp; Your soul is so
steeped in illusions; so submerged in the Lethean waters of the
past; so emasculated by thrilling legends, paltry titles, and
ruined castles, that you forget that Pestalozzi was the father of
popular education and the sometime teacher of Froebel, our patron
saint.&nbsp; When you return to your adored Boston, your faithful
constituents in that and other suburbs of Salem, Massachusetts,
will not ask you if you have seen the Castle of Chillon and the
terrace of Corinne, but whether you went to Yverdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salemina gave one last fond look at the lake and picked up her
Baedeker.&nbsp; She searched languidly in the Y&rsquo;s and
presently read in a monotonous, guide-book voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Um&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;yes, here it is, &lsquo;Yverdon
is sixty-one miles from Geneva, three hours forty minutes, on the
way to Neuch&acirc;tel and B&acirc;le.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Neuch&acirc;tel is the cheese place; I&rsquo;d rather go there
and we could take a bag of those Swiss cakes.)&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
on the southern bank of Lake Neuch&acirc;tel at the influx of the
Orbe or Thiele.&nbsp; It occupies the site of the Roman town of
Ebrodunum.&nbsp; The castle dates from the twelfth century and
was occupied by Pestalozzi as a college.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was at eight, and at nine, leaving Francesca in bed, we
were in the station at Geneva.&nbsp; Finding that we had time to
spare, we went across the street and bargained for an
<i>in-transit</i> luncheon with one of those dull native
shopkeepers who has no idea of American-French.</p>
<p>Your American-French, by the way, succeeds well enough so long
as you practise, in the seclusion of your apartment, certain
assorted sentences which the phrase-book tells you are likely to
be needed.&nbsp; But so far as my experience goes, it is always
the unexpected that happens, and one is eternally falling into
difficulties never encountered by any previous traveller.</p>
<p>For instance, after purchasing a cold chicken, some French
bread, and a bit of cheese, we added two bottles of
lemonade.&nbsp; We managed to ask for a glass, from which to
drink it, but the man named two francs as the price.&nbsp; This
was more than Salemina could bear.&nbsp; Her spirit was never
dismayed at any extravagance, but it reared its crested head in
the presence of extortion.&nbsp; She waxed wroth.&nbsp; The man
stood his ground.&nbsp; After much crimination and recrimination
I threw myself into the breach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salemina,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I wish to remark,
first: That we have three minutes to catch the train.&nbsp;
Second: That, occupying the position we do in America,&mdash;you
the member of a School Board and I the Honorary President of a
Froebel Society,&mdash;we cannot be seen drinking lemonade from a
bottle, in a public railway carriage; it would be too
convivial.&nbsp; Third: You do not understand this
gentleman.&nbsp; You have studied the language longer than I, but
I have studied it more lately than you, and I am fresher, much
fresher than you.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here Salemina bridled
obviously.)&nbsp; &ldquo;The man is not saying that two francs is
the price of the glass.&nbsp; He says that we can pay him two
francs now, and if we will return the glass to-night when we come
home he will give us back one franc fifty centimes.&nbsp; That is
fifty centimes for the rent of the glass, as I understand
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salemina&rsquo;s right hand, with the glass in it, dropped
nervelessly at her side.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he uttered one single
syllable of all that rigmarole, then Ollendorf is a myth,
that&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gift of tongues is not vouchsafed to all,&rdquo; I
responded with dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I happen to possess a talent
for languages, and I apprehend when I do not
comprehend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salemina was crushed by the weight of my self-respect, and we
took the tumbler, and the train.</p>
<p>It was a cloudless day and a beautiful journey, along the side
of the sapphire lake for miles, and always in full view of the
glorious mountains.&nbsp; We arrived at Yverdon about noon, and
had eaten our luncheon on the train, so that we should have a
long, unbroken afternoon.&nbsp; We left our books and heavy wraps
in the station with the porter, with whom we had another slight
misunderstanding as to general intentions and terms; then we
started, Salemina carrying the lemonade glass in her hand, with
her guide-book, her red parasol, and her Astrakhan cape.&nbsp;
The tumbler was a good deal of trouble, but her heart was set on
returning it safely to the Geneva pirate; not so much to reclaim
the one franc fifty centimes as to decide conclusively whether he
had ever proposed such restitution.&nbsp; I knew her mental
processes, so I refused to carry any of her properties; besides,
the pirate had used a good many irregular verbs in his
conversation, and upon due reflection I was a trifle nervous
about the true nature of the bargain.</p>
<p>The Yverdon station fronted on a great open common dotted with
a few trees.&nbsp; There were a good many mothers and children
sitting on the benches, and a number of young lads playing
ball.&nbsp; The town itself is one of the quaintest, quietest,
and sleepiest in Switzerland.&nbsp; From 1803 to 1810 it was a
place of pilgrimage for philanthropists from all parts of Europe;
for at that time Pestalozzi was at the zenith of his fame, having
under him one hundred and sixty-five pupils from Europe and
America, and thirty-two adult teachers, who were learning his
method.</p>
<p>But Yverdon has lost its former greatness now!&nbsp; Scarcely
any English travellers go there and still fewer Americans.&nbsp;
We fancied that there was nothing extraordinary in our
appearance; nevertheless a small crowd of children followed at
our heels, and the shopkeepers stood at their open doors and
regarded us with intense interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No English spoken here, that is evident,&rdquo; said
Salemina ruefully; &ldquo;but you have such a gift for languages
you can take the command to-day and make the blunders and bear
the jeers of the public.&nbsp; You must find out where the new
Pestalozzi Monument is,&mdash;where the Ch&acirc;teau
is,&mdash;where the schools are, and whether visitors are
admitted,&mdash;whether there is a respectable hotel where we can
get dinner,&mdash;whether we can get back to Geneva to-night,
whether it&rsquo;s a fast or a slow train, and what time it gets
there,&mdash;whether the methods of Pestalozzi are still
maintained,&mdash;whether they know anything about
Froebel,&mdash;whether they know what a kindergarten is, and
whether they have one in the village.&nbsp; Some of these
questions will be quite difficult even for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, the monument was not difficult to find, at all
events.&nbsp; We accosted two or three small boys and demanded
boldly of one of them, &ldquo;<i>O&ugrave; est le monument de
Pestalozzi</i>, <i>s&rsquo;il vous pla&icirc;t</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders like an American small boy and said
vacantly, &ldquo;<i>Je ne sais pas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he does know,&rdquo; said Salemina; &ldquo;he
means to be disagreeable; or else &lsquo;monument&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;there is a monument in
the distance, and there cannot be two in this village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough it was the very one we sought.&nbsp; It stands in
a little open place quite &ldquo;in the business heart of the
city,&rdquo;&mdash;as we should say in America, and is an
exceedingly fine and impressive bit of sculpture.&nbsp; The group
of three figures is in bronze and was done by M. Gruet of
Paris.</p>
<p>The modelling is strong, the expression of Pestalozzi benign
and sweet, and the trusting upturned faces of the children
equally genuine and attractive.</p>
<p>One side of the pedestal bears the inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>&Agrave;</i><br />
<i>Pestalozzi</i><br />
1746&ndash;1827<br />
<i>Monument &eacute;rig&eacute;</i><br />
<i>par souscription populaire</i><br />
<i>MDCCCXC</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a second side these words are carved in the
stone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Sauveur des Pauvres
&agrave; Neuhof</i><br />
<i>P&egrave;re des Orphelins &agrave; Stanz</i><br />
<i>Fondateur de l&rsquo;&eacute;cole</i><br />
<i>populaire &agrave; Burgdorf</i><br />
<i>&Eacute;ducateur de l&rsquo;humanit&eacute;</i><br />
<i>&agrave; Yverdon</i><br />
<i>Tout pour les autres</i>, <i>pour
lui</i>,&mdash;<i>rien</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An older monument erected in 1846 by the Canton of Argovia
bears this same inscription, save that it adds, &ldquo;Preacher
to the people in &lsquo;Leonard and Gertrude.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Man.&nbsp; Christian.&nbsp; Citizen.&nbsp; Blessed be his
name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the third side of the Yverdon Monument is
Pestalozzi&rsquo;s noble speech, fine enough indeed, to be cut in
stone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>J&rsquo;ai
v&eacute;cu moi-m&ecirc;me</i><br />
<i>comme un mendiant</i>,<br />
<i>pour apprendre &agrave; des</i><br />
<i>mendiants &agrave; vivre comme</i><br />
<i>des hommes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We sat a long time on the great marble pedestal, gazing into
the benevolent face, and reviewing the simple, self-sacrificing
life of the great educator, and then started on a tour of
inspection.&nbsp; After wandering through most of the shops,
buying photographs and mementoes, Salemina discovered that she
had left the expensive tumbler in one of them.&nbsp; After a long
discussion as to whether tumbler was masculine or feminine, and
as to whether &ldquo;<i>Ai-je laiss&eacute; un verre
ici</i>?&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Est-ce que j&rsquo;ai laiss&eacute;
un verre ici</i>?&rdquo; was the proper query, we retraced our
steps, Salemina asking in one shop, &ldquo;<i>Excusez-moi</i>,
<i>je vous prie</i>, <i>mais ai-je laiss&eacute; un verre
ici</i>?&rdquo;,&mdash;and I in the next, &ldquo;<i>Je demands
pardon</i>, <i>Madame</i>, <i>est-ce que j&rsquo;ai laiss&eacute;
un verre dans ce magasin-ci</i>?&mdash;<i>J&rsquo;en ai perdu
un</i>, somewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally we found it, and in
response not to mine but to Salemina&rsquo;s question, so that
she was superior and obnoxious for several minutes.</p>
<p>Our next point of interest was the old castle, which is still
a public school.&nbsp; Finding the caretaker, we visited first
the museum and library&mdash;a small collection of curiosities,
books, and mementoes, various portraits of Pestalozzi and his
wife, manuscripts and so forth.&nbsp; The simple-hearted woman
who did the honours was quite overcome by our knowledge of and
interest in her pedagogical hero, but she did not return the
compliment.&nbsp; I asked her if the townspeople knew about
Friedrich Froebel, but she looked blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Froebel?&nbsp; Froebel?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;<i>qui
est-ce</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais</i>, <i>Madame</i>,&rdquo; I said eloquently,
&ldquo;<i>c&rsquo;&eacute;tait un grand homme</i>!&nbsp; <i>Un
h&eacute;ros</i>!&nbsp; <i>Le plus grand &eacute;l&egrave;ve de
Pestalozzi</i>!&nbsp; <i>Aussi grand que Pestalozzi
soi-m&ecirc;me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Plus</span> grand!&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you say <i>plus grand</i>?&rdquo; murmured Salemina
loyally.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Je ne sais</i>!&rdquo; she returned, with an
indifferent shrug of the shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Je ne
sais</i>!&nbsp; <i>Il y a des autres</i>, <i>je crois</i>;
<i>mais moi</i>, <i>je connais Pestalozzi</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est
assez</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the younger children had gone home, but she took us
through the empty schoolrooms, which were anything but
attractive.&nbsp; We found an unhappy small boy locked in one of
them.&nbsp; I slipped behind the concierge to chat with him, for
he was so exactly like all other small boys in disgrace that he
made me homesick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tu &eacute;tais m&eacute;chant</i>, <i>n&rsquo;est
ce-pas</i>?&rdquo; I whispered consolingly; &ldquo;<i>mais tu
seras sage demain</i>, <i>j&rsquo;en suis
s&ucirc;re</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought this very pretty, but he wriggled from under my
benevolent hand, saying &ldquo;<i>Va</i>!&rdquo; (which I took to
be, &ldquo;Go &rsquo;long, you!&rdquo;) &ldquo;<i>je
n&rsquo;&eacute;tais m&eacute;chant aujourd&rsquo;hui et je ne
serai pas sage demain</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked the concierge if the general methods of Pestalozzi
were still used in the schools of Yverdon, &ldquo;<i>Mais
certainement</i>!&rdquo; she replied as we went into a room where
twenty to thirty girls of ten years were studying.&nbsp; There
were three pleasant windows looking out into the street; the
ordinary platform and ordinary teacher&rsquo;s table, with the
ordinary teacher (in an extraordinary state of coma) behind it;
and rather rude desks and seats for the children, but not a
single ornament, picture, map, or case of objects and specimens
around the room.&nbsp; The children were nice, clean, pleasant,
stolid little things with braided hair and pinafores.&nbsp; The
sole decoration of the apartment was a highly-coloured chart that
we had noticed on the walls of all the other schoolrooms.&nbsp;
Feeling that this must be a sacred relic, and that it probably
illustrated some of the Pestalozzian foundation principles, I
walked up to it reverently,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce-que c&rsquo;est cela</i>,
<i>Madame</i>?&rdquo; I inquired, rather puzzled by its
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est la m&eacute;thode de
Pestalozzi</i>,&rdquo; the teacher replied absently.</p>
<p>I wished that we kindergarten people could get Froebel&rsquo;s
educational idea in such a snug, portable shape, and drew nearer
to gaze at it.&nbsp; I can give you a very complete description
of the pictures from memory, as I copied the titles <i>verbatim
et literatim</i>.&nbsp; The whole chart was a powerful moral
object-lesson on the dangers of incendiarism and the evils of
reckless disobedience.&nbsp; It was printed appropriately in the
most lurid colours, and divided into nine tableaux.</p>
<p>These were named as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h3>I&mdash;<span class="smcap">La Vraie
Ga&icirc;t&eacute;</span></h3>
<p>Twelve or fifteen boys and girls are playing together so
happily and innocently that their good angels sing for joy.</p>
<h3>II&mdash;<span class="smcap">Une Proposition
Fatale</span>!</h3>
<p>Suddenly &ldquo;<i>le petit</i> Charles&rdquo; says to his
comrades, &ldquo;Come! let us build a fire!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Le
petit</i> Charles is a typical infant villain and is surrounded
at once by other incendiary spirits all in accord with his
insidious plans.</p>
<h3>III&mdash;<span class="smcap">La Protestation</span></h3>
<p>The Good Little Marie, a Sunday-school heroine of the true
type, approaches the group and, gazing heavenward, remarks that
it is wicked to play with matches.&nbsp; The G. L. M. is of
saintly presence,&mdash;so clean and well groomed that you feel
inclined to push her into a puddle.&nbsp; Her hands are not full
of vulgar toys and sweetmeats, like those of the other children,
but are extended graciously as if she were in the habit of
pronouncing benedictions.</p>
<h3>IV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Insouciance</span>!</h3>
<p><i>Le petit</i> Charles puts his evil little paw in his
dangerous pockets and draws out a wicked lucifer match, saying
with abominable indifference, &ldquo;Bah! what do we care?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re going to build a fire, whatever you say.&nbsp; Come
on, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>V&mdash;<span class="smcap">Un Plaisir Dangereux</span>!</h3>
<p>The boys &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Led by &ldquo;<i>le
petit vilain</i> Charles&rdquo; they light a dangerous little
fire in a dangerous little spot.&nbsp; Their faces shine with
unbridled glee.&nbsp; The G. L. M. retires to a distance with a
few saintly followers, meditating whether she shall run and tell
her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Le petit</i> Paul,&rdquo; an infant
of three summers, draws near the fire, attracted by the cheerful
blaze.</p>
<h3>VI&mdash;<span class="smcap">Malheur et
Inexp&eacute;rience</span></h3>
<p><i>Le petit</i> Paul somehow or other tumbles into the
fire.&nbsp; Nothing but a desire to influence posterity as an
awful example could have induced him to take this unnecessary
step, but having walked in he stays in, like an infant John
Rogers.&nbsp; The bad boys are so horror-stricken it does not
occur to them to pull him out, and the G. L. M. is weeping over
the sin of the world.</p>
<h3>VII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trop Tard</span>!!</h3>
<p>The male parent of <i>le petit</i> Paul is seen rushing down
an adjacent Alp.&nbsp; He leads a flock of frightened villagers
who have seen the smoke and heard the wails of their
offspring.&nbsp; As the last shred of <i>le petit</i> Paul has
vanished in said smoke, the observer notes that the poor father
is indeed &ldquo;too late.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>VIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Desespoir</span>!!</h3>
<p>The despair of all concerned would draw tears from the dryest
eye.&nbsp; Only one person wears a serene expression, and that is
the G. L. M., who is evidently thinking: &ldquo;Perhaps they will
listen to me the next time.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IX&mdash;<span class="smcap">La Fin</span>!</h3>
<p>The charred remains of <i>le petit</i> Paul are being carried
to the cemetery.&nbsp; The G. L. M. heads the procession in a
white veil.&nbsp; In a prominent place among the mourners is
&ldquo;<i>le pauvre petit</i> Charles,&rdquo; so bowed with grief
and remorse that he can scarcely be recognized.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was a telling sermon!&nbsp; If I had been a child I should
never have looked at a match again; and old as I was, I could
not, for days afterwards, regard a box of them without a
shudder.&nbsp; I thought that probably Yverdon had been visited
in the olden time by a series of disastrous holocausts, all set
by small boys, and that this was the powerful antidote presented;
so I asked the teacher whether incendiarism was a popular failing
in that vicinity and whether the chart was one of a series
inculcating various moral lessons.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether she understood me or not, but she said no, it was
&ldquo;<i>la m&eacute;thode de Pestalozzi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this juncture she left the room, apparently to give
the pupils a brief study-period, and simultaneously the concierge
was called downstairs by a crying baby.&nbsp; A bright idea
occurred to me and I went hurriedly into the corridor where my
friend was taking notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salemina,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here is an opportunity
of a lifetime!&nbsp; We ought to address these children in their
native tongue.&nbsp; It will be something to talk about in
educational pow-wows.&nbsp; They do not know that we are
distinguished visitors, but we know it.&nbsp; A female member of
a School Board and the Honorary President of a Froebel Society
owe a duty to their constituents.&nbsp; You go in and tell them
who and what I am and make a speech in French.&nbsp; Then
I&rsquo;ll tell them who and what you are and make another
speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salemina assumed a modest violet attitude, declined the honour
absolutely, and intimated that there were persons who would
prefer talking in a language they didn&rsquo;t know rather than
to remain sensibly silent.</p>
<p>However the plan struck me as being so fascinating that I went
back alone, looked all ways to see if any one were coming,
mounted the platform, cleared my throat, and addressed the
awe-struck youngsters in the following words.&nbsp; I will spare
you the French, but you will perceive by the construction of the
sentences, that I uttered only those sentiments possible in an
early stage of language-study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;I live many
thousand miles across the ocean in America.&nbsp; You do not know
me and I do not know you, but I do know all about your good
Pestalozzi and I love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Il est mort</i>!&rdquo; interpolated one offensive
little girl in the front row.</p>
<p>Salemina tittered audibly in the corridor, and I crossed the
room and closed the door.&nbsp; I think the children expected me
to put the key in my pocket and then murder them and stuff them
into the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know perfectly well that he is dead, my child,&rdquo;
I replied winningly,&mdash;&ldquo;it is his life, his memory that
I love.&mdash;And once upon a time, long ago, a great man named
Friedrich Froebel came here to Yverdon and studied with your
great Pestalozzi.&nbsp; It was he who made kindergartens for
little children, <i>jardins des enfants</i>, you know.&nbsp; Some
of your grand-mothers remember Froebel, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon two of the smaller chits shouted some sort of a
negation which I did not in the least comprehend, but which from
large American experience I took to be, &ldquo;My grandmother
doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My grandmother
doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that the others regarded me favourably, I continued,
&ldquo;It is because I love Pestalozzi and Froebel, that I came
here to day to see your beautiful new monument.&nbsp; I have just
bought a photograph taken on that day last year when it was first
uncovered.&nbsp; It shows the flags and the decorations, the
flowers and garlands, and ever so many children standing in the
sunshine, dressed in white and singing hymns of praise.&nbsp; You
are all in the picture, I am sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a happy stroke.&nbsp; The children crowded about me
and showed me where they were standing in the photograph, what
they wore on the august occasion, how the bright sun made them
squint, how a certain <i>malheureuse</i> Henriette couldn&rsquo;t
go to the festival because she was ill.</p>
<p>I could understand very little of their magpie chatter, but it
was a proud moment.&nbsp; Alone, unaided, a stranger in a strange
land, I had gained the attention of children while speaking in a
foreign tongue.&nbsp; Oh, if I had only left the door open that
Salemina might have witnessed this triumph!&nbsp; But hearing
steps in the distance, I said hastily,
&ldquo;<i>Asseyez-vous</i>, <i>mes enfants</i>,
<i>tout-de-suite</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; My tone was so authoritative
that they obeyed instantly, and when the teacher entered it was
as calm as the millennium.</p>
<p>We rambled through the village for another hour, dined at a
quaint little inn, gave a last look at the monument, and left for
Geneva at seven o&rsquo;clock in the pleasant September
twilight.&nbsp; Arriving a trifle after ten, somewhat weary in
body and slightly anxious in mind, I followed Salemina into the
tiny cake-shop across the street from the station.&nbsp; She
returned the tumbler, and the man, who seemed to consider it an
unexpected courtesy, thanked us volubly.&nbsp; I held out my hand
and reminded him timidly of the one franc fifty centimes.</p>
<p>He inquired what I meant.&nbsp; I explained.&nbsp; He laughed
scornfully.&nbsp; I remonstrated.&nbsp; He asked me if I thought
him an imbecile.&nbsp; I answered no, and wished that I knew the
French for several other terms nearer the truth, but equally
offensive.&nbsp; Then we retired, having done our part, as good
Americans, to swell the French revenues, and that was the end of
our day in Pestalozzi-town; not the end, however, of the lemonade
glass episode, which was always a favourite story in
Salemina&rsquo;s repertory.</p>

PENELOPE IN VENICE</h2>

cities I saw in my journey, partly because she gave me most
louing and kinde entertainment for the sweetest time (I must

<h3>I</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>,
<i>May</i> 12<br />
<span class="smcap">Hotel Paolo Anafesto</span>.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> always wished that I might
have discovered Venice for myself.&nbsp; In the midst of our mad
acquisition and frenzied dissemination of knowledge, these latter
days, we miss how many fresh and exquisite sensations!&nbsp; Had
I a daughter, I should like to inform her mind on every other
possible point and keep her in absolute ignorance of
Venice.&nbsp; Well do I realize that it would be impracticable,
although no more so, after all, than Rousseau&rsquo;s plan of
educating &Eacute;mile, which certainly obtained a wide hearing
and considerable support in its time.&nbsp; No, tempting as it
would be, it would be difficult to carry out such a theory in
these days of logic and common sense, and in some moment of
weakness I might possibly succumb and tell her all about it, for
fear that some stranger, whom she might meet at a ball, would
have the pleasure of doing it first.</p>
<p>The next best woman-person in the world with whom to see
Venice, barring the lovely non-existent daughter, is
Salemina.</p>
<p>It is our first visit, but, alas! we are, nevertheless, much
better informed than I could wish.&nbsp; Salemina&rsquo;s mind is
particularly well furnished, but, luckily she cannot always
remember the point wished for at the precise moment of need; so
that, taking her all in all, she is nearly as agreeable as if she
were ignorant.&nbsp; Her knowledge never bulks heavily and
insistently in the foreground or middle-distance, like that of
Miss Celia Van Tyck, but remains as it should, in the haze of a
melting and delicious perspective.&nbsp; She has plenty of
enthusiasms, too, and Miss Van Tyck has none.&nbsp; Imagine our
plight at being accidentally linked to that encyclop&aelig;dic
lady in Italy!&nbsp; She is an old acquaintance of
Salemina&rsquo;s and joined us in Florence, where she had been
staying for a month, waiting for her niece Kitty
Schuyler,&mdash;Kitty Copley now,&mdash;who is in Spain with her
husband.</p>
<p>Miss Van Tyck would be endurable in Sheffield, Glasgow, Lyons,
Genoa, Kansas City, Pompeii, or Pittsburg, but she should never
have blighted Venice with her presence.&nbsp; She insisted,
however, on accompanying us, and I can only hope that the climate
and associations will have a relaxing effect on her habits of
thought and speech.&nbsp; When she was in Florence, she was so
busy in &ldquo;reading up&rdquo; Verona and Padua that she had no
time for the Uffizi Gallery.&nbsp; In Verona and Padua she was
absorbed in Hare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Venice,&rdquo; vaccinating
herself, so to speak, with information, that it might not steal
upon, and infect her, unawares.&nbsp; If there is anything that
Miss Van abhors, it is knowing a thing without knowing that she
knows it; while for me, the most charming knowledge is the sort
that comes by unconscious absorption, like the free grace of
God.</p>
<p>We intended to enter Venice in orthodox fashion, by moonlight,
and began to consult about trains when we were in Milan.&nbsp;
The porter said that there was only one train between the eight
and the twelve, and gave me a pamphlet on the subject, but
Salemina objects to an early start, and Miss Van refuses to
arrive anywhere after dusk, so it is fortunate that the distances
are not great.</p>
<p>They have a curious way of reckoning time in Italy, for I
found that the train leaving Milan at eight-thirty was scheduled
to arrive at ten minutes past eighteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could never sit up until then, Miss Van,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;but, on the other hand, if we leave later, to please
Salemina, say at ten in the morning, we do not arrive until eight
minutes before twenty-one!&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t the faintest
idea what time that will really be, but it sounds too late for
three defenceless women&mdash;all of them unmarried&mdash;to be
prowling about in a strange city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It proved on investigation, however, that twenty-one
o&rsquo;clock is only nine in Christian language (that is,
one&rsquo;s mother tongue), so we united in choosing that hour as
being the most romantic possible, and there was a full yellow
moon as we arrived in the railway station.&nbsp; My heart beat
high with joy and excitement, for I succeeded in establishing
Miss Van with Salemina in one gondola, while I took all the
luggage in another, ridding myself thus cleverly of the
disenchanting influence of Miss Van&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come with us, Penelope,&rdquo; she said, as we
issued from the portico of the station and heard, instead of the
usual cab-drivers&rsquo; pandemonium, only the soft lapping of
waves against the marble steps&mdash;&ldquo;Do come with us,
Penelope, and let us enter &lsquo;dangerous and sweet-charmed
Venice&rsquo; together.&nbsp; It does, indeed, look a
&lsquo;veritable sea-bird&rsquo;s nest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had informed me before, in Milan, that Cassiodorus,
Theodoric&rsquo;s secretary, had thus styled Venice, but somehow
her slightest remark is out of key.&nbsp; I can always see it
printed in small type in a footnote at the bottom of the page,
and I always wish to skip it, as I do other footnotes, and
annotations, and marginal notes and addenda.&nbsp; If Miss
Van&rsquo;s mother had only thought of it, Addenda would have
been a delightful Christian name for her, and much more
appropriate than Celia.</p>
<p>If I should be asked on bended knees, if I should be reminded
that every intelligent and sympathetic creature brings a pair of
fresh eyes to the study of the beautiful, if it should be
affirmed that the new note is as likely to be struck by the
&rsquo;prentice as by the master hand, if I should be assured
that my diary would never be read, I should still refuse to write
my first impressions of Venice.&nbsp; My best successes in life
have been achieved by knowing what not to do, and I consider it
the finest common sense to step modestly along in beaten paths,
not stirring up, even there, any more dust than is
necessary.&nbsp; If my friends and acquaintances ever go to
Venice, let them read their Ruskin, their Goethe, their Byron,
Shelley, and Wordsworth, their Rogers, Gautier, Michelet, their
Symonds and Howells, not forgetting old &ldquo;Coryat&rsquo;s
Crudities,&rdquo; and be thankful I spared them mine.</p>
<p>It was the eve of Ascension Day, and a yellow May moon was
hanging in the blue.&nbsp; I wished with all my heart that it
were a little matter of seven or eight hundred years earlier in
the world&rsquo;s history, for then the people would have been
keeping vigil and making ready for that nuptial ceremony of
Ascension-tide when the Doge married Venice to the sea.&nbsp; Why
can we not make pictures nowadays, as well as paint them?&nbsp;
We are banishing colour as fast as we can, clothing our
buildings, our ships, ourselves, in black and white and sober
hues, and if it were not for dear, gaudy Mother Nature, who never
puts her palette away, but goes on painting her reds and greens
and blues and yellows with the same lavish hand, we should have a
sad and discreet universe indeed.</p>
<p>But so long as we have more or less stopped making pictures,
is it not fortunate that the great ones of the olden time have
been eternally fixed on the pages of the world&rsquo;s history,
there to glow and charm and burn for ever and a day?&nbsp; To be
able to recall those scenes of marvellous beauty so vividly that
one lives through them again in fancy, and reflect, that since we
have stopped being picturesque and fascinating, we have learned,
on the whole, to behave much better, is as delightful a trend of
thought as I can imagine, and it was mine as I floated toward the
Piazza of San Marco in my gondola.</p>
<p>I could see the Doge descend the Giant&rsquo;s Stairs, and
issue from the gate of the Ducal Palace.&nbsp; I could picture
the great Bucentaur as it reached the open beyond the line of the
tide.&nbsp; I could see the white-mitred Patriarch walking from
his convent on the now deserted isle of Sant&rsquo; Elena to the
shore where his barge lay waiting to join the glittering
procession.</p>
<p>And then there floated before my entranced vision the princely
figure of the Doge taking the Pope-blessed ring, and, advancing
to the little gallery behind his throne on the Bucentaur, raising
it high, and dropping it into the sea.&nbsp; I could almost hear
the faint splash as it sank in the golden waves, and hear, too,
the sonorous words of the old wedding ceremony:
&ldquo;<i>Desponsamus te</i>, <i>Mare</i>, <i>in signum veri
perpetuique dominii</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when the shouts of mirth and music had died away and the
Bucentaur and its train had drifted back into the lagoon, the
blue sea, new-wedded, slept through the night with the May moon
on her breast and the silent stars for sentinels.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">La
Giudecca</span>, <i>May</i> 15,<br />
<span class="smcap">Casa Rosa</span>.</p>
<p>Not for a moment have we regretted leaving our crowded,
conventional hotel in Venice proper, for these rooms in a house
on the Giudecca.&nbsp; The very vision of Miss Celia Van Tyck
sitting on a balcony surrounded by a group of friends from the
various Boston suburbs, the vision of Miss Celia Van Tyck melting
into delicious distance with every movement of our gondola, even
this was sufficient for Salemina&rsquo;s happiness and mine, had
it been accompanied by no more tangible joys.</p>
<p>This island, hardly ten minutes by gondola from the Piazza of
San Marco, was the summer resort of the Doges, you will remember,
and there they built their pleasure-houses, with charming gardens
at the back&mdash;gardens the confines of which stretched to the
Laguna Viva.&nbsp; Our Casa Rosa is one of the few old
<i>palazzi</i> left, for many of them have been turned into
granaries.</p>
<p>We should never have found this romantic dwelling by
ourselves; the Little Genius brought us here.&nbsp; The Little
Genius is Miss Ecks, who draws, and paints, and carves, and
models in clay, preaching and practising the brotherhood of man
and the sisterhood of woman in the intervals; Miss Ecks, who is
the custodian of all the talents and most of the virtues, and the
invincible foe of sordid common sense and financial
prosperity.&nbsp; Miss Ecks met us by chance in the Piazza and
breathlessly explained that she was searching for paying guests
to be domiciled under the roof of Numero Sessanta,
Giudecca.&nbsp; She thought we should enjoy living there, or at
least she did very much, and she had tried it for two years; but
our enjoyment was not the special point in question.&nbsp; The
real reason and desire for our immediate removal was that the
padrona might pay off a vexatious and encumbering mortgage which
gave great anxiety to everybody concerned, besides interfering
seriously with her own creative work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come this very day,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Ecks.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Madonna knows that we do not desire
boarders, but you are amiable and considerate, as well as
financially sound and kind, and will do admirably.&nbsp; Padrona
Angela is very unhappy, and I cannot model satisfactorily until
the house is on a good paying basis and she is putting money in
the bank toward the payment of the mortgage.&nbsp; You can order
your own meals, entertain as you like, and live precisely as if
you were in your own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Little Genius is small, but powerful, with a style of
oratory somewhat illogical, but always convincing at the
moment.&nbsp; There were a good many trifling objections to our
leaving Miss Van Tyck and the hotel, but we scarcely remembered
them until we and our luggage were skimming across the space of
water that divides Venice from our own island.</p>
<p>We explored the cool, wide, fragrant spaces of the old
<i>casa</i>, with its outer walls of faded, broken stucco, all
harmonized to a pinkish yellow by the suns and winds of the
bygone centuries.&nbsp; We admired its lofty ceilings, its lovely
carvings and frescoes, its decrepit but beautiful furniture, and
then we mounted to the top, where the Little Genius has a sort of
eagle&rsquo;s eyrie, a floor to herself under the eaves, from the
windows of which she sees the sunlight glimmering on the blue
water by day, and the lights of her adored Venice glittering by
night.&nbsp; The walls are hung with fragments of marble and wax
and stucco and clay; here a beautiful foot, or hand, or
dimple-cleft chin; there an exquisitely ornate fa&ccedil;ade, a
miniature campanile, or a model of some ancient <i>palazzo</i> or
<i>chiesa</i>.</p>
<p>The little bedroom off at one side is draped in coarse white
cotton, and is simple enough for a nun.&nbsp; Not a suggestion
there of the fripperies of a fine lady&rsquo;s toilet, but, in
their stead, heads of cherubs, wings of angels, slender
bell-towers, friezes of acanthus leaves,&mdash;beauty of line and
form everywhere, and not a hint of colour save in the riotous
bunches of poppies and oleanders that lie on the broad
window-seats or stand upright in great blue jars.</p>
<p>Here the Little Genius lives, like the hermit crab that she
calls herself; here she dwells apart from kith and kin, her mind
and heart and miracle-working hands taken captive by the charms
of the siren city of the world.</p>
<p>When we had explored Casa Rosa from turret to foundation stone
we went into the garden at the rear of the house&mdash;a garden
of flowers and grape-vines, of vegetables and fruit-trees, of
birds and bee-hives, a full acre of sweet summer sounds and
odours, stretching to the lagoon, which sparkled and shimmered
under the blue Italian skies.&nbsp; The garden completed our
subjugation, and here we stay until we are removed by force, or
until the padrona&rsquo;s mortgage is paid unto the last penny,
when I feel that the Little Genius will hang a banner on the
outer ramparts, a banner bearing the relentless inscription:
&ldquo;No paying guests allowed on these premises until further
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our domestics are unique and interesting.&nbsp; Rosalia, the
cook, is a graceful person with brown eyes, wavy hair, and long
lashes, and when she is coaxing her charcoal fire with a
primitive fan of cock&rsquo;s feathers, her cheeks as pink as
oleanders, the Little Genius leads us to the kitchen door and
bids us gaze at her beauty.&nbsp; We are suitably enthralled at
the moment, but we suffer an inevitable reaction when the meal is
served, and sometimes long for a plain cook.</p>
<p>Peppina is the second maid, and as arrant a coquette as lives
in all Italy.&nbsp; Her picture has been painted on more than one
fisherman&rsquo;s sail, for it is rumoured that she has been six
times betrothed and she is still under twenty.&nbsp; The
unscrupulous little flirt rids herself of her suitors, after they
become a weariness to her, by any means, fair or foul, and her
capricious affections are seldom good for more than three
months.&nbsp; Her own loves have no deep roots, but she seems to
have the power of arousing in others furious jealousy and rage
and a very delirium of pleasure.&nbsp; She remains light, gay,
joyous, unconcerned, but she shakes her lovers as the Venetian
thunderstorms shake the lagoons.&nbsp; Not long ago she tired of
her chosen swain, Beppo the gardener, and one morning the
padrona&rsquo;s ducks were found dead.&nbsp; Peppina, her eyes
dewy with crocodile tears, told the padrona that although the
suspicion almost rent her faithful heart in twain, she must needs
think Beppo the culprit.&nbsp; The local detective, or police
officer, came and searched the unfortunate Beppo&rsquo;s humble
room, and found no incriminating poison, but did discover a pound
or two of contraband tobacco, whereupon he was marched off to
court, fined eighty francs, and jilted by his perfidious
lady-love, who speedily transferred her affections.&nbsp; If she
had been born in the right class and the right century, Peppina
would have made an admirable and brilliant Borgia.</p>
<p>Beppo sent a stinging reproof in verse to Peppina by the new
gardener, and the Little Genius read it to us, to show the poetic
instinct of the discarded lover, and how well he had selected his
rebuke from the store of popular verses known to gondoliers and
fishermen of Venice:&mdash;</p>

She&rsquo;ll swear to you, and there it ends,<br />
Trust not the mast that bends.&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beppo, Salemina, and I were talking together one
morning,&mdash;just a casual meeting in the street,&mdash;when
Peppina passed us.&nbsp; She had a market-basket in each hand,
and was in her gayest attire, a fresh crimson rose between her
teeth being the last and most fetching touch to her toilet.&nbsp;
She gave a dainty shrug of her shoulders as she glanced at
Beppo&rsquo;s hanging head and hungry eye, and then with a light
laugh hummed, &ldquo;Trust not the mast that bends,&rdquo; the
first line of the poem that Beppo had sent her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better to let her go,&rdquo; I said to him
consolingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>, <i>madama</i>; but&rdquo;&mdash;with a
profound sigh&mdash;&ldquo;she is very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she is, and although my idea of the fitness of things is
somewhat unsettled when Peppina serves our dinner wearing a yoke
and sleeves of coarse lace with her blue cotton gown, and a bunch
of scarlet poppies in her hair, I can do nothing in the way of
discipline because Salemina approves of her as part of the
picture.&nbsp; Instead of trying to develop some moral sense in
the little creature, Salemina asked her to alternate roses and
oleanders with poppies in her hair, and gave her a coral comb and
ear-rings on her birthday.&nbsp; Thus does a warm climate
undermine the strict virtue engendered by Boston east winds.</p>
<p>Francesco&mdash;Cecco for short&mdash;is general assistant in
the kitchen, and a good gondolier to boot.&nbsp; When our little
family is increased by more than three guests at dinner, Cecco is
pressed into dining-room service, and becomes under-butler to
Peppina.&nbsp; Here he is not at ease.&nbsp; He scrubs his tanned
face until it shines like San Domingo mahogany, brushes his black
hair until the gloss resembles a varnish, and dons coarse white
cotton gloves to conceal his work-stained hands and give an air
of fashion and elegance to the banquet.&nbsp; His embarrassment
is equalled only by his earnestness and devotion to the dreaded
task.&nbsp; Our American guests do not care what we have upon our
bill of fare when they can steal a glance at the intensely
dramatic and impassioned Cecco taking Pina into a corner of the
dining-room and, seizing her hand, despairingly endeavour to find
out his next duty.&nbsp; Then, with incredibly stiff back, he
extends his right hand to the guest, as if the proffered plate
held a scorpion instead of a tidbit.&nbsp; There is an extra
butler to be obtained when the function is a sufficiently grand
one to warrant the expense, but as he wears carpet slippers and
Pina flirts with him from soup to fruit, we find ourselves no
better served on the whole, and prefer Cecco, since he transforms
an ordinary meal into a beguiling comedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter, after all?&rdquo; asks
Salemina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not life we are living, for the
moment, but an act of light opera, with the scenes all
beautifully painted, the music charming and melodious, the
costumes gay and picturesque.&nbsp; We are occupying
exceptionally good seats, and we have no responsibility whatever:
we left it in Boston, where it is probably rolling itself larger
and larger, like a snowball; but who cares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares, indeed?&rdquo; I echo.&nbsp; We are here not
to form our characters or to improve our minds, but to let them
relax; and when we see anything which opposses the Byronic ideal
of Venice (the use of the concertina as the national instrument
having this tendency), we deliberately close our eyes to
it.&nbsp; I have a proper regard for truth in matters of fact
like statistics.&nbsp; I want to know the exact population of a
town, the precise total of children of school age, the number of
acres in the Yellowstone Park, and the amount of wheat exported
in 1862; but when it comes to things touching my imagination I
resent the intrusion of some laboriously excavated truth, after
my point of view is all nicely settled, and my saints, heroes,
and martyrs are all comfortably and picturesquely arranged in
their respective niches or on their proper pedestals.</p>
<p>When the Man of Fact demolishes some pretty fallacy like
William Tell and the apple, he should be required to substitute
something equally delightful and more authentic.&nbsp; But he
never does.&nbsp; He is a useful but uninteresting creature, the
Man of Fact, and for a travelling companion or a neighbour at
dinner give me the Man of Fancy, even if he has not a grain of
exact knowledge concealed about his person.&nbsp; It seems to me
highly important that the foundations of Glasgow, Birmingham,
Manchester, or Spokane Falls should be rooted in certainty; but
Verona, Padua, and Venice&mdash;well, in my opinion, they should
be rooted in Byron and Ruskin and Shakespeare.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Casa
Rosa</span>, <i>May</i> 18.</p>
<p>Such a fanfare of bells as greeted our ears on the morning of
our first awakening in Casa Rosa!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise at once and dress quickly, Salemina!&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Either an heir has been born to the throne, or
a foreign Crown Prince has come to visit Venice, or perhaps a
Papal Bull is loose in the Piazza San Marco.&nbsp; Whatever it
is, we must not miss it, as I am keeping a diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peppina entered with a jug of hot water, and assured us
that there were no more bells than usual; so we lay drowsily in
our comfortable little beds, gazing at the frescoes on the
ceiling.</p>
<p>One difficulty about the faithful study of Italian frescoes is
that they can never be properly viewed unless one is extended at
full-length on the flat of one&rsquo;s honourable back (as they
might say in Japan), a position not suitable in a public
building.</p>
<p>The fresco on my bedroom ceiling is made mysteriously
attractive by a wilderness of mythologic animals and a crowd of
cherubic heads, wings and legs, on a background of clouds; the
mystery being that the number of cherubic heads does not
correspond with the number of extremities, one or two cherubs
being a wing or a leg short.&nbsp; Whatever may be their
limitations in this respect, the old painters never denied their
cherubs cheek, the amount of adipose tissue uniformly provided in
that quarter being calculated to awake envy and jealousy on the
part of the predigested-food-babies pictured in the American
magazine advertisements.</p>
<p>Padrona Angela furnishes no official key to the
ceiling-paintings of Casa Rosa; and yesterday, during the
afternoon call of four pretty American girls, they asked and
obtained our permission to lie upon the marble floor and compete
for a prize to be given to the person who should offer the
cleverest interpretation of the symbolisms in the frescoes.&nbsp;
It may be stated that the entire difference of opinion proved
that mythologic art is apt to be misunderstood.&nbsp; After
deciding in the early morning what our bedroom ceiling is
intended to represent (a decision made and unmade every day since
our arrival), Salemina and I make a leisurely toilet and then
seat ourselves at one of the open windows for breakfast.</p>
<p>The window itself looks on the Doge&rsquo;s Palace and the
Campanile, St. Theodore and the Lion of St. Mark&rsquo;s being
visible through a maze of fishing-boats and sails, some of these
artistically patched in white and yellow blocks, or orange and
white stripes, while others of grey have smoke-coloured figures
in the tops and corners.</p>
<p>Sometimes the broad stone-flagging pavement bordering the
canal is busy with people: gondoliers, boys with nets for
crab-catching, &rsquo;longshoremen, and <i>facchini</i>.&nbsp;
This is when ships are loading or unloading, but at other times
we look upon a tranquil scene.</p>
<p>Peppina brings in <i>dell&rsquo; acqua bollente</i>, and I
make the coffee in the little copper coffee-pot we bought in
Paris, while Salemina heats the milk over the alcohol-lamp, which
is the most precious treasure in her possession.</p>
<p>The butter and eggs are brought every morning before
breakfast, and nothing is more delicious than our freshly churned
pat of solidified cream, without salt, which is sweeter than
honey in the comb.&nbsp; The cows are milked at dawn on the
campagna, and the milk is brought into Venice in large
cans.&nbsp; In the early morning, when the light is beginning to
steal through the shutters, one hears the tinkling of a
mule&rsquo;s bell and the rattling of the milk-cans, and, if one
runs to the window, may see the <i>contadini</i>, looking, in
their sheepskin trousers, like brethren of John the Baptist,
driving through the streets and delivering the milk at the
<i>vaccari</i>.&nbsp; It is then heated, the cream raised and
churned, and the pats of butter, daintily set on green leaves,
delivered for a seven-o&rsquo;clock breakfast.</p>
<p>Finally <i>la colazione</i> is spread on our table by the
window.&nbsp; A neat white cloth covers it, and we have
gold-rimmed plates and cups of delicate china.&nbsp; There is a
pot of honey, an egg <i>&agrave; la coque</i> for each, a plate
of brown and white bread, on some days a dish of scarlet cherries
on a bed of green, on others a mound of luscious berries in their
frills; sometimes, too, we have a bowl of tiny wild strawberries
that seem to have grown with their faces close pressed to the
flowers, so sweet and fragrant are they.</p>
<p>This <i>al fresco</i> morning meal makes a delicious prelude
to our comfortable <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la fourchette</i>
at one o&rsquo;clock, when the Little Genius, if not absorbed in
some unusually exacting piece of work, joins us and gives zest to
the repast.&nbsp; Her own breakfast, she explains, is a
<i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la</i> thumb, the sort enjoyed by the
peasant who carves a bit of bread and cheese in his hand, and she
promises us a sight, some leisure day, of a certain
<i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la</i> toothpick celebrated for the
moment among the artists.&nbsp; A mysterious painter, shabby, but
of a certain elegance and distinction even in his poverty, comes
daily at noon into a well-known restaurant.&nbsp; He buys for
five sous a glass of chianti, a roll for one sou, and with
stately grace bestows another sou upon the waiter who serves
him.&nbsp; These preparations made, he breaks the roll in small
bits, and poising them delicately on the point of a wooden
toothpick, he dips them in wine before eating them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be a frugal repast,&rdquo; he has an air of
saying, &ldquo;but it is at least refined, and no man would dare
insult me by asking me whether or not I leave the table
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Casa
Rosa</span>, <i>May</i> 20.</p>
<p>One of the pleasantest sights to be noted from our windows at
breakfast time is Angelo making ready our private gondola for the
day.&nbsp; Angelo himself is not attractive to the eye by reason
of the silliest possible hat for a man of forty-five whose hair
is slightly grey.&nbsp; It is a white straw sailor, with a
turned-up brim, a blue ribbon encircling the crown, and a white
elastic under the chin; such a hat as you would expect to see
crowning the flaxen curls of mother&rsquo;s darling boy of
four.</p>
<p>I love to look at the gondola, with its solemn caracoling like
that of a possible water-horse, of which the arched neck is the
graceful <i>ferro</i>.&nbsp; This is a strange, weird, beautiful
thing when the black gondola sways a little from side to side in
the moonlight.&nbsp; Angelo keeps ours polished so that it shines
like silver in the morning sun, and he has an exquisite
conscientiousness in rubbing every trace of brass about his
precious craft.&nbsp; He has a little box under the prow full of
bottles and brushes and rags.&nbsp; The cushions are laid on the
bank of the canal; the pieces of carpet are taken out, shaken,
and brushed, and the narrow strips are laid over the curved wood
ends of the gondola to keep the sun from cracking them.&nbsp; The
<i>felze</i>, or cabin, is freed of all dust, the tiny
four-legged stools and the carved chair are wiped off, and
occasionally a thin coat of black paint is needed here and there,
and a touching-up of the gold lines which relieve the
sombreness.&nbsp; The last thing to be done is to polish the
vases and run back into the garden for nosegays, and when these
are disposed in their niches on each side of the <i>felze</i>,
Angelo waves his infantile hat gaily to us at the window, and
smiles his readiness to be off.</p>
<p>On other mornings we watch the loading and unloading of
grain.&nbsp; There are many small boats always in view, their
orange sails patched with all sorts of emblems and designs in a
still deeper colour, and day before yesterday a large ship
appeared at our windows and attached itself to our very
doorsteps, much to the wrath of Salemina, who finds the poetry of
existence much disturbed under the new conditions.&nbsp; All is
life and motion now.&nbsp; The men are stripped naked to the
waist, with bright handkerchiefs on their heads, and, in many
cases, others tied over their mouths.&nbsp; Each has a thick wisp
of short twine strings tucked into his waistband.&nbsp; The bags
are weighed by one, who takes out or puts in a shovelful of
grain, as the case may be.&nbsp; Then the carrier ties up his bag
with one of the twine strings, two other men lift it to his
shoulder, while a boy removes a pierced piece of copper from a
long wire and gives it to him, this copper being handed in turn
to still another man, who apparently keeps the account.&nbsp;
This not uninteresting, indeed, but sordid and monotonous
operation began before eight yesterday morning and even earlier
to-day, obliging Salemina to decline strawberries and eat her
breakfast with her back to the window.</p>
<p>This afternoon at four the injured lady departed on a tour in
Miss Palett&rsquo;s gondola.&nbsp; Miss Palett is a
water-colourist who has lived in Venice for five years and speaks
the language &ldquo;like a native.&rdquo;&nbsp; (You are familiar
with the phrase, and perhaps familiar, too, with the native like
whom they speak.)</p>
<p>Returning after tea, Salemina was observed to radiate a kind
of subdued triumph, which proved on investigation to be due to
the fact that she had met the <i>comandante</i> of the offending
ship and that he had gallantly promised to remove it without
delay.&nbsp; I cannot help feeling that the proper time for
departure had come; but this destroys the story and robs the
<i>comandante</i> of his reputation for chivalry.</p>
<p>As Miss Palett&rsquo;s gondola neared the grain-ship,
Salemina, it seems, spied the commanding officer pacing the
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said to her companion, &ldquo;there is
a gang-plank from the side of the ship to that small
flat-boat.&nbsp; We could perfectly well step from our gondola to
the flat-boat and then go up and ask politely if we may be
allowed to examine the interesting grain-ship.&nbsp; While you
are interviewing the first officer about the foreign countries he
has seen, I will ask the <i>comandante</i> if he will kindly tie
his boat a little farther down on the island.&nbsp; No, that
won&rsquo;t do, for he may not speak English; we should have an
awkward scene, and I should defeat my own purposes.&nbsp; You are
so fluent in Italian, suppose you call upon him with my card and
let me stay in the gondola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I say to the man?&rdquo; objected Miss
Palett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s plenty to say,&rdquo; returned
Salemina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him that Penelope and I came over
from the hotel on the Grand Canal only that we might have perfect
quiet.&nbsp; Tell him that if I had not unpacked my largest
trunk, I should not stay an instant longer.&nbsp; Tell him that
his great, bulky ship ruins the view; that it hides the most
beautiful church and part of the Doge&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp; Tell
him that I might as well have stayed at home and built a cottage
on the dock in Boston Harbour.&nbsp; Tell him that his
steam-whistles, his anchor-droppings, and his constant loadings
or unloadings give us headache.&nbsp; Tell him that seven or
eight of his sailormen brought clean garments and scrubbing
brushes and took their bath at our front entrance.&nbsp; Tell him
that one of them, almost absolutely nude, instead of running away
to put on more clothing, offered me his arm to assist me into the
gondola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Palett demurred at the subject-matter of some of these
remarks, and affirmed that she could not translate others into
proper Italian.&nbsp; She therefore proposed that Salemina should
write a few dignified protests on her visiting-card, and her own
part would be to instruct the man in the flat-boat to deliver it
at once to his superior officer.&nbsp; The <i>comandante</i>
spoke no English,&mdash;of that fact the sailorman in the
flat-boat was certain,&mdash;but as the gondola moved away, the
ladies could see the great man pondering over the little piece of
pasteboard, and it was plain that he was impressed.&nbsp; Herein
lies perhaps a seed of truth.&nbsp; The really great thing
triumphs over all obstacles, and reaches the common mind and
heart in some way, delivering its message we know not how.</p>
<p>Salemina&rsquo;s card teemed with interesting information, at
least to the initiated.&nbsp; Her surname was in itself a
passport into the best society.&nbsp; To be an X&mdash; was
enough of itself, but her Christian name was one peculiar to the
most aristocratic and influential branch of the X&mdash;s.&nbsp;
Her mother&rsquo;s maiden name, engraved at full length in the
middle, established the fact that Mr. X&mdash; had not married
beneath him, but that she was the child of unblemished lineage on
both sides.&nbsp; Her place of residence was the only one
possible to the possessor of three such names, and as if these
advantages were not enough, the street and number proved that
Salemina&rsquo;s family undoubtedly possessed wealth; for the
small numbers, and especially the odd numbers, on that particular
street, could be flaunted only by people of fortune.</p>
<p>You have now all the facts in your possession, and I can only
add that the ship weighed anchor at twilight, so Salemina again
gazed upon the Doge&rsquo;s Palace and slept tranquilly.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Casa
Rosa</span>, <i>May</i> 22</p>
<p>I am like the schoolgirl who wrote home from Venice: &ldquo;I
am sitting on the edge of the Grand Canal drinking it all in, and
life never seemed half so full before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was ever the
city so beautiful as last night on the arrival of foreign
royalty?&nbsp; It was a memorable display and unique in its
peculiar beauty.&nbsp; The palaces that line the canal were
bright with flags; windows and water-steps were thronged, the
broad centre of the stream was left empty.&nbsp; Presently, round
the bend below the Rialto, swept into view a double line of
gondolas&mdash;long, low, gleaming with every hue of brilliant
colour, most of them with ten, some with twelve, gondoliers in
resplendent liveries, red, blue, green, white, orange, all
bending over their oars with the precision of machinery and the
grace of absolute mastery of their craft.&nbsp; In the middle,
between two lines, came one small and beautifully modelled
gondola, rowed by four men in red and black, while on the white
silk cushions in the stern sat the Prince and Princess.&nbsp;
There was no splash of oar or rattle of rowlock; swiftly,
silently, with an air of stately power and pride, the lovely
pageant came, passed, and disappeared under the shining evening
sky and the gathering shadows of &ldquo;the dim, rich
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; I never saw, or expect to see, anything of its
kind so beautiful.</p>
<p>I stay for hours in the gondola, writing my letters or
watching the thousand and one sights of the streets, for I often
allow Salemina and the Little Genius to tread their way through
the highways and byways of Venice while I stay behind and observe
life from beneath the grateful shade of the black
<i>felze</i>.</p>
<p>The women crossing the many little bridges look like the
characters in light opera; the young girls, with their hair
bobbed in a round coil, are sometimes bareheaded and sometimes
have a lace scarf over their dark, curly locks.&nbsp; A little
fan is often in their hands, and one remarks the graceful way in
which the crepe shawl rests upon the women&rsquo;s shoulders,
remembering that it is supposed to take generations to learn to
wear a shawl or wield a fan.</p>
<p>My favourite waiting-place is near the Via del Paradiso, just
where some scarlet pomegranate blossoms hang out over the old
brick walls by the canal-side, and where one splendid acanthus
reminds me that its leaves inspired some of the most beautiful
architecture in the world; where, too, the ceaseless chatter of
the small boys cleaning crabs with scrubbing-brushes gives my ear
a much-needed familiarity with the language.</p>
<p>Now a girl with a red parasol crosses the Ponte del Paradiso,
making a brilliant silhouette against the blue sky.&nbsp; She
stops to prattle with the man at the bell-shop just at the corner
of the little <i>calle</i>.&nbsp; There are beautiful bells
standing in rows in the window, one having a border of finely
traced crabs and sea-horses at the base; another has a top like a
Doge&rsquo;s cap, while the body of another has a delicately
wrought tracery, as if a fish-net had been thrown over it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the children crowd about me as the pigeons in the
Piazza San Marco struggle for the corn flung to them by the
tourists.&nbsp; If there are only three or four, I sometimes
compromise with my conscience and give them something.&nbsp; If
one gets a lira put into small coppers, one can give them a
couple of <i>centesimi</i> apiece without feeling that one is
pauperizing them, but that one is fostering the begging habit in
young Italy is a more difficult sin to face.</p>
<p>To-day when the boys took off the tattered hats from their
bonny little heads, all black waves and riotous curls, and with
disarming dimples and sparkling eyes presented them to me for
alms, I looked at them with smiling admiration, thinking how like
Raphael&rsquo;s cherubs they were, and then said in my best
Italian: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I see them; they are indeed most
beautiful hats.&nbsp; I thank you for showing them to me, and I
am pleased to see you courteously take them off to a
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This American pleasantry was passed from mouth to mouth
gleefully, and so truly enjoyed that they seemed to forget they
had been denied.&nbsp; They ran, still laughing and chattering,
to the wood-carver&rsquo;s shop near-by and told him the story,
or so I judged, for he came to his window and smiled benignly
upon me as I sat in the gondola with my writing-pad on my
knees.&nbsp; I was pleased at the friendly glance, for he is the
hero of a pretty little romance, and I long to make his
acquaintance.</p>
<p>It seems that, some years ago, the Queen, with one
lady-in-waiting in attendance, came to his shop quite early in
the morning.&nbsp; Both were plainly dressed in cotton gowns, and
neither made any pretensions.&nbsp; He was carving something that
could not be dropped, a cherub&rsquo;s face that had to be
finished while his thought of it was fresh.&nbsp; Hurriedly
asking pardon, he continued his work, and at end of an hour
raised his eyes, breathless and apologetic, to look at his
visitors.&nbsp; The taller lady had a familiar appearance.&nbsp;
He gazed steadily, and then, to his surprise and embarrassment,
recognized the Queen.&nbsp; Far from being offended, she
respected his devotion to his art, and before she left the shop
she gave him a commission for a royal staircase.&nbsp; I am going
to ask the Little Genius to take me to see his work, but, alas!
there will be an unsurmountable barrier between us, for I cannot
utter in my new Italian anything but the most commonplace and
conventional statements.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Casa
Rosa</span>, <i>May</i> 28.</p>
<p>Oh, this misery of being dumb, incoherent, unintelligible,
foolish, inarticulate in a foreign land, for lack of words!&nbsp;
It is unwise, I fear, to have at the outset too high an ideal
either in grammar or accent.&nbsp; As our gondola passed one of
the hotels this afternoon, we paused long enough to hear an
intrepid lady converse with an Italian who carried a mandolin and
had apparently come to give a music lesson to her husband.&nbsp;
She seemed to be from the Middle West of America, but I am not
disposed to insist upon this point, nor to make any particular
State in the Union blush for her crudities of speech.&nbsp; She
translated immediately everything that she said into her own
tongue, as if the hearer might, between French and English,
possibly understand something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Elle nay pars easy</i>&mdash;he ain&rsquo;t
here,&rdquo; she remarked, oblivious of gender.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Elle retoorneray ah seas oors et
dammi</i>&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be back sure by half-past six.&nbsp;
<i>Bone swar</i>, I should say <i>Bony
naughty</i>&mdash;Good-night to you, and I won&rsquo;t let him
forget to show up to-morrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was neither so ingenious nor so felicitous as the
language-expedient of the man who wished to leave some luggage at
a railway station in Rome, and knowing nothing of any foreign
tongue but a few Latin phrases, mostly of an obituary character,
pointed several times to his effects, saying,
&ldquo;<i>Requiescat in pace</i>,&rdquo; and then, pointing again
to himself, uttered the one pregnant word
&ldquo;<i>Resurgam</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This at any rate had the
merit of tickling his own sense of humour, if it availed nothing
with the railway porters, and if any one remarks that he has read
the tale in some ancient &ldquo;Farmers&rsquo; Almanack,&rdquo; I
shall only retort that it is still worth repeating.</p>
<p>My little red book on the &ldquo;Study of Italian Made Easy
for the Traveller&rdquo; is always in my pocket, but it is
extraordinary how little use it is to me.&nbsp; The critics need
not assert that individuality is dying out in the human race and
that we are all more or less alike.&nbsp; If we were, we should
find our daily practical wants met by such little books.&nbsp;
Mine gives me a sentence requesting the laundress to return the
clothes three days hence, at midnight, at cock-crow, or at the
full of the moon, but nowhere can the new arrival find the phrase
for the next night or the day after to-morrow.&nbsp; The book
implores the washerwoman to use plenty of starch, but the new
arrival wishes scarcely any, or only the frills dipped.</p>
<p>Before going to the dressmaker&rsquo;s yesterday, I spent five
minutes learning the Italian for the expression &ldquo;This
blouse bags; it sits in wrinkles between the
shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; As this was the only criticism given in
the little book, I imagined that Italian dressmakers erred in
this special direction.&nbsp; What was my discomfiture to find
that my blouse was much too small and refused to meet.&nbsp; I
could only use gestures for the dressmaker&rsquo;s enlightenment,
but in order not to waste my recently gained knowledge, I tried
to tell a melodramatic tale of a friend of mine whose blouse
bagged and sat in wrinkles between the shoulders.&nbsp; It was
not successful, because I was obliged to substitute the past for
the present tense of the verb.</p>
<p>Somebody says that if we learn the irregular verbs of a
language first, all will be well.&nbsp; I think by the use of
considerable mental agility one can generally avoid them
altogether, although it materially reduces one&rsquo;s
vocabulary; but at all events there is no way of learning them
thoroughly save by marrying a native.&nbsp; A native,
particularly after marriage, uses the irregular verbs with great
freedom, and one acquires a familiarity with them never gained in
the formal instruction of a teacher.&nbsp; This method of
education may be considered radical, and in cases where one is
already married, illegal and bigamous, but on the whole it is not
attended with any more difficulty than the immersing of
one&rsquo;s self in a study day after day and month after month
learning the irregular verbs from a grammar.</p>
<p>My rule in studying a language is to seize upon some salient
point, or one generally overlooked by foreigners, or some very
subtle one known only to the scholar, and devote myself to its
mastery.&nbsp; A little knowledge here blinds the hearer to much
ignorance elsewhere.&nbsp; In Italian, for example, the polite
way of addressing one&rsquo;s equal is to speak in the third
person singular, using <i>Ella</i> (she) as the pronoun.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Come sta Ella</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (How are you? but
literally &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I pay great attention to this detail, and make opportunities
to meet our <i>padrona</i> on the staircase and say &ldquo;How is
she?&rdquo; to her.&nbsp; I can never escape the feeling that I
am inquiring for the health of an absent person; moreover, I
could not understand her symptoms if she should recount them, and
I have no language in which to describe my own symptoms, which,
so far as I have observed, is the only reason we ever ask anybody
else how he feels.</p>
<p>To remember on the instant whether one is addressing equals,
superiors, or inferiors, and to marshal hastily the proper
pronoun, adds a new terror to conversation, so that I find myself
constantly searching my memory to decide whether it shall be:</p>
<p><i>Scusate</i> or <i>Scusi</i>, <i>Avanti</i> or <i>Passi</i>,
<i>A rivederci</i> or <i>Addio</i>, <i>Che cosa dite</i>? or
<i>Che coma dice</i>?&nbsp; <i>Quanto domandate</i>? or <i>Quanto
domanda</i>?&nbsp; <i>Dove andate</i>? or <i>Dove va</i>?&nbsp;
<i>Come vi chiamate</i>? or <i>Come si chiama</i>? and so forth
and so forth until one&rsquo;s mind seems to be arranged in
tabulated columns, with special N.B.&rsquo;s to use the
infinitive in talking to the gondolier.</p>
<p>Finding the hours of time rather puzzling as recorded in the
&ldquo;Study of Italian Made Easy,&rdquo; I devoted twenty-four
hours to learning how to say the time from one o&rsquo;clock at
noon to midnight, or thirteen to twenty-three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; My soul revolted at the task, for a foreign
tongue abounds in these malicious little refinements of speech,
invented, I suppose, to prevent strangers from making too free
with it on short acquaintance.&nbsp; I found later on that my
labour had been useless, and that evidently the Italians
themselves have no longer the leisure for these little
eccentricities of language and suffer them to pass from common
use.&nbsp; If the Latin races would only meet in convention and
agree to bestow the comfortable neuter gender on inanimate
objects and commodities, how popular they might make themselves
with the English-speaking nations; but having begun to
&ldquo;enrich&rdquo; their language, and make it more
&ldquo;subtle&rdquo; by these perplexities, centuries ago, they
will no doubt continue them until the end of time.</p>
<p>If one has been a devoted patron of the opera or student of
music, one has an Italian vocabulary to begin with.&nbsp; This,
if accompanied by the proper gestures (for it is vain to speak
without liberal movements, of the hands, shoulders, and
eyebrows), this, I maintain, will deceive all the
English-speaking persons who may be seated near your table in a
foreign caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>The very first evening after our arrival, Jack Copley asked
Salemina and me to dine with him at the best restaurant in
Venice.&nbsp; Jack Copley is a well of nonsense undefiled, and
he, like ourselves, had been in Italy only a few hours.&nbsp; He
called for us in his gondola, and in the row across from the
Giudecca we amused ourselves by calling to mind the various
Italian words or phrases with which we were familiar.&nbsp; They
were mostly titles of arias or songs, but Jack insisted,
notwithstanding Salemina&rsquo;s protestations, that, properly
interlarded with names of famous Italians, he could maintain a
brilliant conversation with me at table, to the envy and
amazement of our neighbours.&nbsp; The following paragraph, then,
was our stock in trade, and Jack&rsquo;s volubility and ingenuity
in its use kept Salemina quite helpless with laughter:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Guarda che bianca luna</i>&mdash;<i>Il tempo
passato</i>&mdash;<i>Lascia ch&rsquo; io
pianga</i>&mdash;<i>Dolce far niente</i>&mdash;<i>Batti batti nel
Masetto</i>&mdash;<i>Da
capo</i>&mdash;<i>Ritardando</i>&mdash;<i>Andante</i>&mdash;<i>Piano</i>&mdash;<i>Adagio</i>&mdash;<i>Spaghetti</i>&mdash;<i>Macaroni</i>&mdash;<i>Polenta</i>&mdash;<i>Non
&egrave; ver</i>&mdash;<i>Ah, non giunge</i>&mdash;<i>Si la
stanchezza</i>&mdash;<i>Bravo</i>&mdash;<i>Lento</i>&mdash;<i>Presto</i>&mdash;<i>Scherzo</i>&mdash;<i>Dormi
pura</i>&mdash;<i>La ci darem la mano</i>&mdash;<i>Celeste
A&iuml;da</i>&mdash;<i>Spirito gentil</i>&mdash;<i>Voi che
sapete</i>&mdash;<i>Crispino e la
Comare</i>&mdash;<i>Piet&agrave;,
Signore</i>&mdash;<i>Tintoretto</i>&mdash;<i>Boccaccio</i>&mdash;<i>Garibaldi</i>&mdash;<i>Mazzini</i>&mdash;<i>Beatrice
Cenci</i>&mdash;<i>Gordigiani</i>&mdash;<i>Santa
Lucia</i>&mdash;<i>Il mio
tesoro</i>&mdash;<i>Margherita</i>&mdash;<i>Umberto</i>&mdash;<i>Vittoria
Colonna</i>&mdash;<i>Tutti
frutti</i>&mdash;<i>Botticelli</i>&mdash;<i>Una furtiva
lagrima</i>.</p>
<p>No one who has not the privilege of Jack Copley&rsquo;s
acquaintance could believe with what effect he used these
unrelated words and sentences.&nbsp; I could only assist, and
lead him to ever higher flights of fancy.</p>
<p>We perceive with pleasure that our mother tongue presents
equal difficulties to Italian manufacturers and men of
affairs.&nbsp; The so-called mineral water we use at table is
specially still and dead, and we think it may have been compared
to its disadvantage with other more sparkling beverages, since
every bottle bears a printed label announcing, &ldquo;To Distrust
of the mineral waters too foaming, since that they do invariable
spread the Stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We learn also by studying another bottle that &ldquo;The
Wermouth is a white wine slightly bitter, and parfumed with who
leso me aromatic herbs.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Who leso me</i> we
printed in italics in our own minds, giving the phrase a pure
Italian accent until we discovered that it was the somewhat
familiar adjective &ldquo;wholesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of the smaller galleries we were given the usual
pasteboard fans bearing explanations of the frescoes:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Room</span> I.&nbsp; <i>In the

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Casa
Rosa</span>, <i>May</i> 30.</p>
<p>We have had a battle royal in Casa Rosa&mdash;a battle over
the breaking of a huge blue pitcher valued at eight francs, a
pitcher belonging to the Little Genius.</p>
<p>The room that leads from the dining-room to the kitchen is
reached by the descent of two or three stone steps.&nbsp; It is
always full, and is like the orthodox hell in one respect, that
though myriads of people are seen to go into it, none ever seem
to come out.&nbsp; It is not more than twelve feet square, and
the persons most continuously in it, not counting those who are
in transit, are the Padrona Angela; the Padrona Angela&rsquo;s
daughter, Signorina Rita; the Signorina Rita&rsquo;s temporary
suitor; the suitor&rsquo;s mother and cousin; the padrona&rsquo;s
great-aunt; a few casual acquaintances of the two families, and
somebody&rsquo;s baby: not always the same baby; any baby answers
the purpose and adds to the confusion and chatter of tongues.</p>
<p>This morning, the door from the dining-room being ajar, I
heard a subdued sort of Bedlam in the distance, and finally went
nearer to the scene of action, finding the cause in a heap of
broken china in the centre of the floor.&nbsp; I glanced at the
excited company, but there was nothing to show me who was the
criminal.&nbsp; There was a spry girl washing dishes; the
fritter-woman (at least we call her so, because she brings
certain goodies called, if I mistake not, <i>frittoli</i>); the
gardener&rsquo;s wife; Angelo, the gondolier; Peppina, the
waiting-maid; and the men that had just brought the sausages and
sweetmeats for the gondolier&rsquo;s ball, which we were giving
in the evening.&nbsp; There was also the contralto, with a large
soup-ladle in her hand.&nbsp; (We now call Rosalia, the cook,
&ldquo;the contralto,&rdquo; because she sings so much better
than she cooks that it seems only proper to distinguish her in
the line of her special talent.)</p>
<p>The assembled company were all talking and gesticulating at
once.&nbsp; There was a most delicate point of justice involved,
for, as far as I could gather, the sweetmeat-man had come in
unexpectedly and collided with the sausage-man, thereby startling
the fritter-woman, who turned suddenly and jostled the spry girl:
hence the pile of broken china.</p>
<p>The spry girl was all for justice.&nbsp; If she had carelessly
or wilfully dropped the pitcher, she would have been willing to
suffer the extreme penalty,&mdash;the number of saints she called
upon to witness this statement was sufficient to prove her
honesty,&mdash;but under the circumstances she would be blessed
if she suffered anything, even the abuse that filled the
air.&nbsp; The fritter-woman upbraided the sweetmeat-man, who in
return reviled the sausage-vender, who remarked that if Angelo or
Peppina had received the sausages at the door, as they should, he
would never have been in the house at all; adding a few
picturesque generalizations concerning the moral turpitude of
Angelo&rsquo;s parents and the vicious nature of their
offspring.</p>
<p>The contralto, who was divided in her soul, being betrothed to
the sausage-vender, but aunt to the spry girl, sprang into the
arena, armed with the soup-ladle, and dispensed injustice on all
sides.&nbsp; The feud now reached its height.&nbsp; There is
nothing that the chief participants did not call one another, and
no intimation or aspersion concerning the reputation of ancestors
to the remotest generation that was not cast in the others&rsquo;
teeth.&nbsp; The spry girl referred to the sausage-vender as a
<i>generalissimo</i> of all the fiends, and the compliments
concerning the gentle art of cookery which flew between the
fritter-woman and the contralto will not bear repetition.&nbsp; I
listened breathlessly, hoping to hear one of the party refer to
somebody as the figure of a pig (strangely enough the most
unforgettable of insults), for each of the combatants held,
suspended in air, the weapon of his choice&mdash;broken crockery,
soup-ladle, rolling-pin, or sausage.&nbsp; Each, I say,
flourished the emblem of his craft wildly in the air&mdash;and
then, with a change of front like that of the celebrated King of
France in the Mother Goose rhyme, dropped it swiftly and
silently; for at this juncture the Little Genius flew down the
broad staircase from her eagle&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; Her
sculptor&rsquo;s smock surmounted her blue cotton gown, and her
blond hair was flying in the breeze created by her rapid
descent.&nbsp; I wish I could affirm that by her gentle dignity
and serene self-control she awed the company into silence, or
that there was a holy dignity about her that held them
spellbound; but such, unhappily, is not the case.&nbsp; It was
her pet blue pitcher that had been broken&mdash;the pitcher that
was to serve as just the right bit of colour at the
evening&rsquo;s feast.&nbsp; She took command of the situation in
a masterly manner&mdash;a manner that had American energy and
decision as its foundation and Italian fluency as its
superstructure.&nbsp; She questioned the virtue of no one&rsquo;s
ancestors, cast no shadow of doubt on the legitimacy of any
one&rsquo;s posterity, called no one by the name of any
four-footed beast or crawling, venomous thing, yet she somehow
brought order out of chaos.&nbsp; Her language (for which she
would have been fined thirty days in her native land) charmed and
enthralled the Venetians by its delicacy, reserve, and restraint,
and they dispersed pleasantly.&nbsp; The sausage-vender wished
good appetite to the cook,&mdash;she had need of it, Heaven
knows, and we had more,&mdash;while the spry girl embraced the
fritter-woman ardently, begging her to come in again soon and
make a longer visit.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Casa
Rosa</span>, <i>June</i> 10</p>
<p>I am saying all my good-byes&mdash;to Angelo and the gondola;
to the greedy pigeons of San Marco, so heavy in the crop that
they can scarcely waddle on their little red feet; to the bees
and birds and flowers and trees of the beautiful garden behind
the <i>casa</i>; to the Little Genius and her eagle&rsquo;s nest
on the house-top; to &ldquo;the city that is always just putting
out to sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been a month of enchantment, and
although rather expensive, it is pleasant to think that the
padrona&rsquo;s mortgage is nearly paid.</p>
<p>It is a saint&rsquo;s day, and to-night there will be a
<i>fiesta</i>.&nbsp; Coming home to our island, we shall hear the
laughter and the song floating out from the wine shops and the
<i>caff&egrave;s</i>; we shall see the lighted barges with their
musicians; we shall thrill with the cries of &ldquo;<i>Viva
Italia</i>! <i>viva el Re</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The moon will rise
above the white palaces; their innumerable lights will be
reflected in the glassy surface of the Grand Canal.&nbsp; We
shall feel for the last time &ldquo;the quick silent
passing&rdquo; of the only Venetian cab.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How light we move, how softly!&nbsp; Ah,<br
/>
Were life but as the gondola!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To-morrow we shall be rowed against the current to
Padua.&nbsp; We shall see Malcontenta and its ruined villa:
Oriago and Mira and the campanile of Dolo.&nbsp; Venice will lie
behind us, but she will never be forgotten.&nbsp; Many a time on
such a night as this we shall say with other wandering
Venetians:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O Venezia benedetta!<br />
Non ti voglio pi&ugrave; lasciar!&rdquo;</p>

PENELOPE&rsquo;S PRINTS OF WALES</h2>
<blockquote><p>And at length it chanced that I came to the
fairest Valley in the World, wherein were trees of equal growth;
and a river ran through the Valley, and a path was by the side of
the river.&nbsp; And I followed the path until midday, and I
continued my journey along the remainder of the Valley until the
evening: and at the extremity of a plain I came to a lone and
lustrous Castle, at the foot of which was a torrent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are coaching in Wales, having
journeyed by easy stages from Liverpool through Llanberis,
Penygwryd, Bettws-y-Coed, Beddgelert and Dolgelly on our way to
Bristol, where we shall make up our minds as to the next step;
deciding in solemn conclave, with floods of argument and
temperamental differences of opinion, what is best worth seeing
where all is beautiful and inspiring.&nbsp; If I had possessed a
little foresight I should have avoided Wales, for, having proved
apt at itinerary doggerel, I was solemnly created, immediately on
arrival, Mistress of Rhymes and Travelling Laureate to the
party&mdash;an office, however honourable, that is no sinecure
since it obliges me to write rhymed eulogies or diatribes on
Dolgelly, Tan-y-Bulch, Gyn-y-Coed, Llanrychwyn, and other Welsh
hamlets whose names offer breakneck fences to the Muse.</p>
<p>I have not wanted for training in this direction, having made
a journey (heavenly in reminiscence) along the Thames, stopping
at all the villages along its green banks.&nbsp; It was Kitty
Schuyler and Jack Copley who insisted that I should rhyme Henley
and Streatley and Wargrave before I should be suffered to eat
luncheon, and they who made me a crown of laurel and hung a
pasteboard medal about my blushing neck when I succeeded better
than usual with Datchett!&mdash;I well remember Datchett, where
the water-rats crept out of the reeds in the shallows to watch
our repast; and better still do I recall Medmenham Abbey, which
defied all my efforts till I found that it was pronounced
Meddenam with the accent on the first syllable.&nbsp; The results
of my enforced tussles with the Muse stare at me now from my
Commonplace Book.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Said a rat to a hen once, at Datchett,<br
/>
&lsquo;Throw an egg to me, dear, and I&rsquo;ll catch
it!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I thank you, good sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I greatly prefer<br />
To sit on mine <i>here</i> till I hatch it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few hairs had the Vicar of Medmenham,<br />
Few hairs, and he still was a-sheddin&rsquo; &rsquo;em,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But had none remained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not have complained,<br />
Because there was <i>far</i> too much red in
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Jack Copley, too, who incited me to play with rhymes
for Venice until I produced the following <i>tour de
force</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A giddy young hostess in Venice<br />
Gave her guests hard-boiled eggs to play tennis.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She said &lsquo;If they <i>should</i> break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What odds would it make?<br />
You can&rsquo;t <i>think</i> how prolific my hen
is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminiscences of former difficulties bravely surmounted faded
into insignificance before our first day in Wales was over.</p>
<p>Jack Copley is very autocratic, almost brutal in
discipline.&nbsp; It is he who leads me up to the Visitors&rsquo;
Books at the wayside inns, and putting the quill in my reluctant
fingers bids me write in cheerful hexameters my impressions of
the unpronounceable spot.&nbsp; My martyrdom began at Penygwryd
(Penny-goo-rid&rsquo;).&nbsp; We might have stopped at Conway or
some other town of simple name, or we might have allowed the roof
of the Cambrian Arms or the Royal Goat or the Saracen&rsquo;s
Read to shelter us comfortably, and provide me a comparatively
easy task; but no; Penygwryd it was, and the outskirts at that,
because of two inns that bore on their swinging signs the names:
<i>Ty Ucha</i> and <i>Ty Isaf</i>, both of which would make any
minor poet shudder.&nbsp; When I saw the sign over the door of
our chosen hostelry I was moved to disappear and avert my
fate.&nbsp; Hunger at length brought me out of my lair, and
promising to do my duty, I was allowed to join the irresponsible
ones at luncheon.</p>
<p>Such a toothsome feast it was!&nbsp; A delicious ham where
roses and lilies melted sweetly into one another; some crisp
lettuces, ale in pewter mugs, a good old cheese, and that stodgy
cannon-ball the &ldquo;household loaf,&rdquo; dear for old
association&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; We were served at table by the
granddaughter of the house, a little damsel of fifteen summers
with sleek brown hair and the eyes of a doe.&nbsp; The pretty
creature was all blushes and dimples and pinafores and curtsies
and eloquent goodwill.&nbsp; With what a sweet politeness do they
invest their service, some of these soft-voiced British
maids!&nbsp; Their kindness almost moves one to tears when one is
fresh from the resentful civility fostered by Democracy.</p>
<p>As we strolled out on the greensward by the hawthorn hedge we
were followed by the little waitress, whose name, however
pronounced, was written Nelw Evans.&nbsp; She asked us if we
would write in the &ldquo;Locked Book,&rdquo; whereupon she
presented us with the key.&nbsp; It seems that there is an
ordinary Visitors&rsquo; Book, where the common herd is invited
to scrawl its unknown name; but when persons of evident
distinction and genius patronize the inn, this &ldquo;Locked
Book&rdquo; is put into their hands.</p>
<p>I found that many a lord and lady had written on its pages,
and men mighty in Church and State had left their mark, with much
bad poetry commendatory of the beds, the food, the scenery, and
the fishing.&nbsp; Nobody, however, had given a line to pretty
Nelw Evans; so I pencilled her a rhyme, for which I was well paid
in dimples:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the Inn called the Penygwryd<br />
A sweet little maiden is hid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so rosy and pretty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I write her this ditty<br />
And leave it at Penygwryd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our next halt was at Bettws-y-Coed, where we passed the
week-end.&nbsp; It was a memorable spot, as I failed at first to
rhyme the name, and only succeeded under threats of a fate like
unto that of the immortal babes in the wood.&nbsp; I left the
verse to be carved on a bronze tablet in the village church,
should any one be found fitted to bear the weight of its
eulogy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies an old woman of
Bettws-y-Co<i>ed</i>;<br />
Wherever she went, it was there that she go<i>ed</i>.<br />
She frequently said: &lsquo;My own row have I ho<i>ed</i>,<br />
And likewise the church water-mark have I to<i>ed</i>.<br />
I&rsquo;m therefore expecting to reap what I&rsquo;ve
sow<i>ed</i>,<br />
And go straight to heaven from
Bettws-y-Co<i>ed</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At another stage of our journey, when the coaching tour was
nearly ended, we were stopping at the Royal Goat at
Beddgelert.&nbsp; We were seated about the cheerful blaze (one
and sixpence extra), portfolio in lap, making ready our letters
for the post.&nbsp; I announced my intention of writing to
Salemina, left behind in London with a sprained ankle, and
determined that the missive should be saturated with local
colour.&nbsp; None of us were able to spell the few Welsh words
we had picked up in our journeyings, but I evaded the
difficulties by writing an exciting little episode in which all
the principal substantives were names of Welsh towns, dragged in
bodily, and so used as to deceive the casual untravelled
reader.</p>
<p>I read it aloud.&nbsp; Jack Copley declared that it made
capital sense, and sounded as if it had happened exactly as
stated.&nbsp; Perhaps you will agree with him:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Ddolghyhggllwn</span>, <span
class="smcap">Wales</span>.</p>
<p>. . . We left Bettws-y-Coed yesterday morning, and coached
thirty-three miles to this point.&nbsp; (How do you like this
point when you see it spelled?)&nbsp; We lunched at a wayside
inn, and as we journeyed on we began to see pposters on the
ffences announcing the ffact that there was to be a Festiniog
that day in the village of Portmadoc, through which we were to
pass.</p>
<p>I always enoyw a Festiniog yn any country, and my hheart beat
hhigh with anticipation.&nbsp; Yt was ffive o&rsquo;clock yn the
cool of the dday, and ppresently the roadw became ggay with the
returning festinioggers.&nbsp; Here was a fine Llanberis, its
neck encircled with shining meddals wonw in previous festiniogs;
there, just behind, a wee shaggy Rhyl led along proudly by its
owner.&nbsp; Evydently the gayety was over for the day, for the
ppeople now came yn crowds, the women with gay plaid Rhuddlans
over their shoulders and straw Beddgelerts on their hheads.</p>
<p>The guardd ttooted his hhorn continuously, for we now
approached the principalw street of the village, where hhundreds
of ppeople were conggreggated.&nbsp; Of course there were allw
manner of Dolgelleys yn the crowd, and allw that had taken
pprizes were gayly decked with ribbons.&nbsp; Just at this moment
the hhorn of our gguard ffrightened a superb Llanrwst, a spirited
black creature of enormous size.&nbsp; It made a ddash through
the lines of tterrified mothers, who caught their innocent
Pwllhelis closer to their bbosoms.&nbsp; In its madd course it
bruised the side of a huge Llandudno hitched to a stout
Tyn-y-Coed by the way-side.&nbsp; It bbroke its Bettws and leaped
ynto the air.&nbsp; Ddeath stared us yn the face.&nbsp; David the
whip grew ppale, and signalled to Absalom the gguard to save as
many lives as he could and leave the rrest to Pprovidence.&nbsp;
Absalom spprang from his seat, and taking a sharp Capel Curig
from his ppocket (Hheaven knows how he chanced to have it about
his pperson), he aimed straight between the Llangollens of the
infuriated Llandudno.&nbsp; With a moan of baffled rrage, he sank
to earth with a hheavy thuddw.&nbsp; Absalom withdrew the bbloody
Capel Curig from the dying Llandudno, and wiping yt on his
Penygwryd, replaced yt yn his pocket for future possible use.</p>
<p>The local Dolwyddelan approached, and ordered a detachment of
Tan-y-Bulchs to remove the corpse of the Llandudno.&nbsp; With a
shudder we saw him borne to his last rrest, for we realized that
had yt not bbeen for Absalom&rsquo;s Capel Curig we had bbeen
bburied yn an unpronounceable Welsh ggrave.</p>

119</span>IV<br />
PENELOPE IN DEVON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are in Bristol after a
week&rsquo;s coaching in Wales; the Jack Copleys, Tommy Schuyler,
Mrs. Jack&rsquo;s younger brother, and Miss Van Tyck, Mrs.
Jack&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aunt Celia,&rdquo; who played a grim third in
that tour of the English Cathedrals during which Jack Copley was
ostensibly studying architecture but in reality courting Kitty
Schuyler.&nbsp; Also there is Bertram Ferguson, whom we call
&ldquo;Atlas&rdquo; because he carries the world on his
shoulders, gazing more or less vaguely and absent-mindedly at all
the persons and things in the universe not in need of immediate
reformation.</p>
<p>We had journeyed by easy stages from Liverpool through
Carnarvon, Llanberis, Penygwyrd, Bettws-y-Coed, Beddgelert, and
Tan-y-Bulch.&nbsp; Arriving finally at Dolgelly, we sent the
coach back to Carnarvon and took the train to Ross,&mdash;the
gate of the Wye,&mdash;from whence we were to go down the river
in boats.&nbsp; As to that, everybody knows Symond&rsquo;s Yat,
Monmouth, Raglan Castle, Tintern Abbey, Chepstow; but at Bristol
a brilliant idea took possession of Jack Copley&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; Long after we were in bed o&rsquo; nights the blessed
man interviewed landlords and studied guidebooks that he might
show us something beautiful next day, and above all, something
out of the common route.&nbsp; Mrs. Jack didn&rsquo;t like common
routes; she wanted her appetite titillated with new scenes.</p>
<p>At breakfast we saw the red-covered Baedeker beside our
host&rsquo;s plate.&nbsp; This was his way of announcing that we
were to &ldquo;move on,&rdquo; like poor Jo in &ldquo;Bleak
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had already reached the marmalade stage,
and while we discussed our bacon and eggs and reviled our coffee,
he read us the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clovelly lies in a narrow and richly-wooded combe
descending abruptly to the sea.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any place that descends to the sea abruptly or
otherwise has my approval in advance,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, my boy.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It consists of
one main street, or rather a main staircase, with a few houses
climbing on each side of the combe so far as the narrow space
allows.&nbsp; The houses, each standing on a higher or lower
level than its neighbour, are all whitewashed, with gay green
doors and lattices.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavenly!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
sounds like an English Amalfi; let us take the first
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;And the general effect is curiously foreign; the
views from the quaint little pier and, better still, from the
sea, with the pier in the foreground, are also very
striking.&nbsp; The foundations of the cottages at the lower end
of the village are hewn out of the living rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does a living rock differ from other
rocks&mdash;dead rocks?&rdquo; Tommy asked facetiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have always wanted to know; however, it sounds
delightful, though I can&rsquo;t remember anything about
Clovelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never read Dickens&rsquo;s &lsquo;Message from
the Sea,&rsquo; Thomas?&rdquo; asked Miss Van Tyck.&nbsp; Aunt
Celia always knows the number of the unemployed in New York and
Chicago, the date when North Carolina was admitted to the Union,
why black sheep eat less than white ones, the height of the
highest mountain and the length of the longest river in the
world, when the first potato was dug from American soil, when the
battle of Bull Run was fought, who invented the first
fire-escape, how woman suffrage has worked in Colorado and
California, the number of trees felled by Mr. Gladstone, the
principle of the Westinghouse brake and the Jacquard loom, the
difference between peritonitis and appendicitis, the date of the
introduction of postal-cards and oleomargarine, the price of
mileage on African railways, the influence of Christianity in the
Windward Islands, who wrote &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Another, not a
Sister,&rdquo; &ldquo;At Midnight in his Guarded Tent,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever,&rdquo; and has taken
in through the pores much other information likely to be of
service on journeys where an encyclop&aelig;dia is not
available.</p>
<p>If she could deliver this information without gibes at other
people&rsquo;s ignorance she would, of course, be more agreeable;
but it is only justice to say that a person is rarely instructive
and agreeable at the same moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is settled, then, that we go to Clovelly,&rdquo;
said Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring me the A B C Guide, please&rdquo;
(this to the waiter who had just brought in the post).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite settled, and we go at once,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Jack, whose joy at arriving at a place is only equalled by her
joy in leaving it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Penelope, hand me my letters,
please; if you were not my guest I should say I had never
witnessed such an appetite.&nbsp; Tommy, what news from
father?&nbsp; Atlas, how can you drink three cups of British
coffee?&nbsp; Oh-h-h, how more than lucky, how heavenly, how
providential!&nbsp; Egeria is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egeria?&rdquo; we cried with one rapturous voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read your letter carefully, Kitty,&rdquo; said Jack;
&ldquo;you will probably find that she wishes she might come, but
finds it impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or that she certainly would come if she had anything to
wear,&rdquo; drawled Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or that she could come perfectly well if it were a few
days later,&rdquo; quoth I.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jack stared at us superciliously, and lifting an absurd
watch from her antique chatelaine, observed calmly, &ldquo;Egeria
will be at this hotel in one hour and fifteen minutes; I
telegraphed her the night before last, and this letter is her
reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Egeria?&rdquo; asked Atlas, looking up from his
own letters.&nbsp; &ldquo;She sounds like a character in a
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;You begin, Penelope.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Penelope</i>: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather finish; then I
can put in everything that you omit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Atlas</i>: &ldquo;Is there so much to tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Tommy</i>: &ldquo;Rather.&nbsp; Begin with her hair,
Penelope.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll do that!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t rattle your knives and forks, shut up your Baedeker,
Jackie, and listen while I quote what a certain poet wrote of
Egeria when she last visited us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She has a knot of russet hair:<br />
It seems a simple thing to wear<br />
Through years, despite of fashion&rsquo;s check,<br />
The same deep coil about the neck,<br />
But there it twined<br />
When first I knew her,<br />
And learned with passion to pursue her,<br />
And if she changed it, to my mind<br />
She were a creature of new kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O first of women who has laid<br />
Magnetic glory on a braid!<br />
In others&rsquo; tresses we may mark<br />
If they be silken, blonde, or dark,<br />
But thine we praise and dare not feel them,<br />
Not Hermes, god of theft, dare steal them;<br />
It is enough for eye to gaze<br />
Upon their vivifying maze.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;She has beautiful hair, but as an
architect I shouldn&rsquo;t think of mentioning it first.&nbsp;
Details should follow, not precede, general
characteristics.&nbsp; Her hair is an exquisite detail; so, you
might say, is her nose, her foot, her voice; but viewed as a
captivating whole, Egeria might be described epigrammatically as
an animated lodestone.&nbsp; When a man approaches her he feels
his iron-work gently and gradually drawn out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atlas looked distinctly incredulous at this statement, which
was reinforced by the affirmative nods of the whole party.</p>
<p><i>Penelope</i>: &ldquo;A man cannot talk to Egeria an hour
without wishing the assistance of the Society for First Aid to
the Injured.&nbsp; She is a kind of feminine fly-paper; the men
are attracted by the sweetness, and in trying to absorb a little
of it, they stick fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Tommy</i>: &ldquo;Egeria is worth from two to two and a
half times more than any girl alive; I would as lief talk to her
as listen to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Atlas</i>: &ldquo;Great Jove, what a concession!&nbsp; I
wish I could find a woman&mdash;an unmarried woman (with a low
bow to Mrs. Jack)&mdash;that would produce that effect upon
me.&nbsp; So you all like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Aunt Celia</i>: &ldquo;She is not what I consider a
well-informed girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Penelope</i>: &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t carp, Miss Van
Tyck.&nbsp; You love her as much as we all do.&nbsp; &lsquo;Like
her,&rsquo; indeed!&nbsp; I detest the phrase.&nbsp; Werther said
when asked how he liked Charlotte, &lsquo;What sort of creature
must he be who merely liked her; whose whole heart and senses
were not entirely absorbed by her!&rsquo;&nbsp; Some one asked me
lately how I &lsquo;liked&rsquo; Ossian.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Atlas</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t introduce Ossian, Werther and
Charlotte into this delightful breakfast chat, I beseech you; the
most tiresome trio that ever lived.&nbsp; If they were travelling
with us, how they would jar!&nbsp; Ossian would tear the scenery
in tatters with his apostrophes, Werther would make love to Mrs.
Jack, and Charlotte couldn&rsquo;t cut an English household loaf
with a hatchet.&nbsp; Keep to Egeria,&mdash;though if one cannot
stop at liking her, she is a dangerous subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine from these panegyrics
that, to the casual observer, Egeria is anything more than a nice
girl.&nbsp; The deadly qualities that were mentioned only appeal
to the sympathetic eye (which you have not), and the susceptible
heart (which is not yours), and after long acquaintance (which
you can&rsquo;t have, for she stays only a week).&nbsp; Tommy,
you can meet the charmer at the station; your sister will pack
up, and I&rsquo;ll pay the bills and make arrangements for the
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack Copley</i> (<i>when left alone with his spouse</i>):
&ldquo;Kitty, I wonder, why you invited Egeria to travel in the
same party with Atlas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i> (<i>fencing</i>): &ldquo;Pooh! Atlas is safe
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;He is a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;No; he is a reformer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;Even reformers fall in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;Not unless they can find a woman to
reform.&nbsp; Egeria is too nearly perfect to attract Atlas;
besides, what does it matter, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;It matters a good deal if it makes him
unhappy; he is too good a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived twenty-five years
and I have never seen a man&rsquo;s unhappiness last more than
six months, and I have never seen a woman make a wound in a
man&rsquo;s heart that another woman couldn&rsquo;t heal.&nbsp;
The modern young man is as tough as&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t
think of anything tough enough to compare him to.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve always thought it a pity that the material of which
men&rsquo;s hearts is made couldn&rsquo;t be utilized for
manufacturing purposes; think of its value for hinges, or for the
toes of little boys&rsquo; boots, or the heels of their
stockings!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;I should think you had just been jilted,
my dear; how has Atlas offended you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t offended me; I love
him, but I think he is too absent-minded lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;And is Egeria invited to join us in order
that she may bring his mind forcibly back to the
present?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;Not at all; I consider Atlas as safe
as a&mdash;as a church, or a dictionary, or a guide-post, or
anything; he is too much interested in tenement-house reform to
fall in love with a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;I think a sensible woman wouldn&rsquo;t be
out of place in Atlas&rsquo; schemes for the regeneration of
humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;No; but Egeria isn&rsquo;t
a&mdash;yes, she is, too; I can&rsquo;t deny it, but I
don&rsquo;t believe she knows anything about the sweating system,
and she adores Ossian and Fiona Macleod, so she probably
won&rsquo;t appeal to Atlas in his present state, which, to my
mind, is unnecessarily intense.&nbsp; The service of humanity
renders a young man perfectly callous to feminine charms.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the proverbial safety of numbers, I suppose, for
it&rsquo;s always the individual that leads a man into
temptation, if you notice, never the universal;&mdash;Woman, not
women.&nbsp; I have studied Atlas profoundly, and he is nearly as
blind as a bat.&nbsp; He paid no attention to my new
travelling-dress last week, and yesterday I wore four rings on my
middle finger and two on each thumb all day long, just to see if
I could catch his eye and hold his attention.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;That may all be; a man may be blind to the
charms of all women but one (and precious lucky if he is), but he
is particularly keen where the one is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;Atlas isn&rsquo;t keen about anything
but the sweating system.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t worry about him;
your favourite Stevenson says that a wet rag goes safely by the
fire, and if a man is blind, he cannot expect to be much
impressed by romantic scenery.&nbsp; Atlas momentarily a wet rag
and temporarily blind.&nbsp; He told me on Wednesday that he
intended to leave all his money to one of those long-named
regenerating societies&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember
which.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;And it was on Wednesday you sent for
Egeria.&nbsp; I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i> (<i>haughtily</i>): &ldquo;Then you see a
figment of your own imagination; there is nothing else to
see.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve packed everything that belongs
to me, while you&rsquo;ve been smoking and gazing at that railway
guide.&nbsp; When do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;11.59.&nbsp; We arrive in Bideford at
4.40, and have a twelve-mile drive to Clovelly.&nbsp; I will
telegraph for a conveyance to the inn and for five bedrooms and a
sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;I hope that Egeria&rsquo;s train will
be on time, and I hope that it will rain so that I can wear my
five-guinea mackintosh.&nbsp; It poured every day when I was
economizing and doing without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Jack</i>: &ldquo;I never could see the value of economy
that ended in extra extravagance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;Very likely; there are hosts of
things you never can see, Jackie.&nbsp; But there she is,
stepping out of a hansom, the darling!&nbsp; What a sweet
gown!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s infinitely more interesting than the
sweating system.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We thought we were a merry party before Egeria joined us, but
she certainly introduced a new element of interest.&nbsp; I could
not help thinking of it as we were flying about the Bristol
station, just before entering the first-class carriage engaged by
our host.&nbsp; Tommy had bought us rosebuds at a penny each;
Atlas had a bundle of illustrated papers under his
arm&mdash;<i>The Sketch</i>, <i>Black and White</i>, <i>The
Queen</i>, <i>The Lady&rsquo;s Pictorial</i>, and half a dozen
others.&nbsp; The guard was pasting an &ldquo;engaged&rdquo;
placard on the carriage window and piling up six luncheon-baskets
in the corner on the cushions, and speedily we were off.</p>
<p>It is a sincere tribute to the intrinsic charm of
Egeria&rsquo;s character that Mrs. Jack and I admire her so
unreservedly, for she is for ever being hurled at us as an
example in cases where men are too stupid to see that there is no
fault in us, nor any special virtue in her.&nbsp; For instance,
Jack tells Kitty that she could walk with less fatigue if she
wore sensible shoes like Egeria&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Now,
Egeria&rsquo;s foot is very nearly as lovely as Trilby&rsquo;s in
the story, and much prettier than Trilby&rsquo;s in the pictures;
consequently, she wears a hideous, broad-toed, low-heeled boot,
and looks trim and neat in it.&nbsp; Her hair is another
contested point: she dresses it in five minutes in the morning,
walks or drives in the rain and wind for a few hours, rides in
the afternoon, bathes in the surf, lies in a hammock, and, if
circumstances demand, the creature can smooth it with her hands
and walk in to dinner!&nbsp; Kitty and I, on the contrary, rise a
half-hour earlier to curl or wave; our spirit-lamps leak into our
dressing-bags, and our beauty is decidedly damaged by damp or hot
weather.&nbsp; Most women&rsquo;s hair is a mere covering to the
scalp, growing out of the head, or pinned on, as the case may
be.&nbsp; Egeria&rsquo;s is a glory like Eve&rsquo;s; it is
expressive, breathing a hundred delicate suggestions of herself;
not tortured into frizzles, or fringes, or artificial shapes, but
winding its lustrous lengths about her head, just high enough to
show the beautiful nape of her neck, &ldquo;where this way and
that the little lighter-coloured irreclaimable curls run truant
from the knot,&mdash;curls, half curls, root curls, vine
ringlets, wedding-rings, fledgling feathers, tufts of down, blown
wisps,&mdash;all these wave, or fall, or stray, loose and
downward in the form of small, silken paws, hardly any of them
thicker than a crayon shading, cunninger than long, round locks
of gold to trick the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock we lifted the covers of our
luncheon-baskets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they the tidiest, most self-respecting,
satisfying things!&rdquo; exclaimed Egeria, as she took out her
plate, and knife, and fork, opened her Japanese napkin, set in
dainty order the cold fowl and ham, the pat of butter, crusty
roll, bunch of lettuce, mustard and salt, the corkscrew, and,
finally, the bottle of ale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot bear to be
unpatriotic, but compare this with the ten minutes for
refreshments at an American lunch-counter, its baked beans, and
pies, and its cream cakes and doughnuts under glass covers.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t believe English people are as good as we are; they
can&rsquo;t be; they&rsquo;re too comfortable.&nbsp; I wonder if
the little discomforts of living in America, the dissatisfaction
and incompetency of servants, and all the other problems, will
work out for the nation a more exceeding weight of glory, or
whether they will simply ruin the national temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wicked to be too luxurious, Egeria,&rdquo;
said Tommy, with a sly look at Atlas.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
hair shirt, not the pearl-studded bosom, that induces
virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she asked innocently, letting her clear
gaze follow Tommy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe,
Mr. Atlas, that modest people like you, and me, and Tommy, and
the Copleys, incur danger in being too comfortable; the trouble
lies in the fact that the other half is too uncomfortable, does
it not?&nbsp; But I am just beginning to think of these
things,&rdquo; she added soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egeria,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jack sternly, &ldquo;you may
think about them as much as you like; I have no control over your
mental processes, but if you mention single tax, or
tenement-house reform, or Socialism, or altruism, or communism,
or the sweating system, you will be dropped at Bideford.&nbsp;
Atlas is only travelling with us because he needs complete moral
and intellectual rest.&nbsp; I hope, oh, how I hope, that there
isn&rsquo;t a social problem in Clovelly!&nbsp; It seems as if
there couldn&rsquo;t be, in a village of a single street and that
a stone staircase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if nothing more
than the problem of supply and demand; of catching and selling
herrings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had time at Bideford to go into a quaint little shop for
tea before starting on our twelve-mile drive; time also to be
dragged by Tommy to Bideford Bridge, that played so important a
part in Kingsley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; We did
not approach Clovelly finally through the beautiful Hobby Drive,
laid out in former years by one of the Hamlyn ladies of Clovelly
Court, but by the turnpike road, which, however, was not
uninteresting.&nbsp; It had been market-day at Bideford and there
were many market carts and &ldquo;jingoes&rdquo; on the road,
with perhaps a heap of yellow straw inside and a man and a rosy
boy on the seat.&nbsp; The roadway was prettily bordered with
broom, wild honeysuckle, fox-glove, and single roses, and there
was a certain charming post-office called the Fairy Cross, in a
garden of blooming fuchsias, where Egeria almost insisted upon
living and officiating as postmistress.</p>
<p>All at once our driver checked his horses on the brink of a
hill, apparently leading nowhere in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Jack, who is always
expecting accidents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clovelly, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clovelly!&rdquo; we repeated automatically, gazing
about us on every side for a roof, a chimney, or a sign of
habitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it, mum, as you walk
down-along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How charming!&rdquo; cried Egeria, who loves the
picturesque.&nbsp; &ldquo;Towns are generally so obtrusive;
isn&rsquo;t it nice to know that Clovelly is here and that all we
have to do is to walk &lsquo;down-along&rsquo; and find it?&nbsp;
Come, Tommy.&nbsp; Ho, for the stone staircase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We who were left behind discovered by more questioning that
one cannot drive into Clovelly; that although an American
president or an English chancellor might, as a great favour, be
escorted down on a donkey&rsquo;s back, or carried down in a
sedan chair if he chanced to have one about his person, the
ordinary mortal must walk to the door of the New Inn, his luggage
being dragged &ldquo;down-along&rdquo; on sledges and brought
&ldquo;up-along&rdquo; on donkeys.&nbsp; In a word, Clovelly is
not built like unto other towns; it seems to have been flung up
from the sea into a narrow rift between wooded hills, and to have
clung there these eight hundred years of its existence.&nbsp; It
has held fast, but it has not expanded, for the very good reason
that it completely fills the hollow in the cliffs, the houses
clinging like limpets to the rocks on either side, so that it
would be a costly and difficult piece of engineering indeed to
build any extensions or additions.</p>
<p>We picked our way &ldquo;down-along&rdquo; until we caught the
first glimpse of white-washed cottages covered with creepers,
their doors hospitably open, their windows filled with blooming
geraniums and fuchsias.&nbsp; All at once, as we began to descend
the winding, rocky pathway, we saw that it pitched headlong into
the bluest sea in the world.&nbsp; No wonder the painters have
loved it!&nbsp; Shall we ever forget that first vision!&nbsp;
There were a couple of donkeys coming &ldquo;up-along&rdquo;
laden, one with coals, the other with bread-baskets; a fisherman
was mending his nets in front of his door; others were lounging
&ldquo;down to quay pool&rdquo; to prepare for their evening
drift-fishing.&nbsp; A little further on, at a certain abrupt
turning called the &ldquo;lookout,&rdquo; where visitors stop to
breathe and villagers to gossip, one could catch a glimpse of the
beach and &ldquo;Crazed Kate&rsquo;s Cottage,&rdquo; the
drying-ground for nets, the lifeboat house, the pier, and the
breakwater.</p>
<p>We were all enchanted when we arrived at the door of the
inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devonshire for me!&nbsp; I shall live here!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said that a few times in Wales,
but I retract it.&nbsp; You had better live here, too, Atlas;
there aren&rsquo;t any problems in Clovelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of that,&rdquo; he assented smilingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I noticed dozens of live snails in the rocks of the street
as we came down; snails cannot live in combination with
problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am a snail,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Jack
cheerfully; &ldquo;for that is exactly my temperament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We found that we could not get room enough for all at the tiny
inn, but this only exhilarated Egeria and Tommy.&nbsp; They
disappeared and came back triumphant ten minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got lodgings without any difficulty,&rdquo; said
Egeria.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tommy&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t half bad; we saw a
small boy who had been taking a box &lsquo;down-along&rsquo; on a
sledge, and he referred us to a nice place where they took Tommy
in; but you should see my lodging&mdash;it is ideal.&nbsp; I
noticed the prettiest yellow-haired girl knitting in a
doorway.&nbsp; &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t room for me at the
inn,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;could you let me sleep
here?&rsquo;&nbsp; She asked her mother, and her mother said
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and there was never anything so romantic as my
vine-embowered window.&nbsp; Juliet would have jumped at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have jumped out of it, if Romeo had been
below,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jack, &ldquo;but there are no Romeos
nowadays; they are all busy settling the relations of labour and
capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Inn proved some years ago to be too small for its
would-be visitors.&nbsp; An addition couldn&rsquo;t be built
because there wasn&rsquo;t any room; but the landlady succeeded
in getting a house across the way.&nbsp; Here there are bedrooms,
a sort of quiet tap-room of very great respectability, and the
kitchens.&nbsp; As the dining-room is in house number one, the
matter of serving dinner might seem to be attended with
difficulty, but it is not apparent.&nbsp; The maids run across
the narrow street with platters and dishes surmounted by great
Britannia covers, and in rainy weather they give the soup or
joint the additional protection of a large cotton umbrella.&nbsp;
The walls of every room in the inn are covered with old china,
much of it pretty, and some of it valuable, though the finest
pieces are not hung, but are placed in glass cabinets.&nbsp; One
cannot see an inch of wall space anywhere in bedrooms, dining- or
sitting-rooms for the huge delft platters, whole sets of the old
green dragon pattern, quaint perforated baskets, pitchers and
mugs of British lustre, with queer dogs, and cats, and peacocks,
and clocks of china.&nbsp; The massing of colour is picturesque
and brilliant, and the whole effect decidedly unique.&nbsp; The
landlady&rsquo;s father and grandfather had been Bideford
sea-captains and had brought here these and other treasures from
foreign parts.&nbsp; As Clovelly is a village of seafolk and
fisher-folk, the houses are full of curiosities, mostly from the
Mediterranean.&nbsp; Egeria had no china in her room, but she had
huge branches of coral, shells of all sizes and hues, and an
immense coloured print of the bay of Naples.&nbsp; Tommy&rsquo;s
landlady was volcanic in her tastes, and his walls were lined
with pictures of Vesuvius in all stages of eruption.&nbsp; My
room, a wee, triangular box of a thing, was on the first floor of
the inn.&nbsp; It opened hospitably on a bit of garden and street
by a large glass door that wouldn&rsquo;t shut, so that a cat or
a dog spent the night by my bed-side now and then, and many a
donkey tried to do the same, but was evicted.</p>
<p>Oh, the Clovelly mornings! the sunshine, the salt air, the
savour of the boats and the nets, the limestone cliffs of
Gallantry Bower rising steep and white at the head of the village
street, with the brilliant sea at the foot; the walks down by the
quay pool (not <i>key pool</i>, you understand, but <i>qua&auml;y
p&uuml;&uuml;l</i> in the vernacular), the sails in a good old
herring-boat called the <i>Lorna Doone</i>, for we are in
Blackmore&rsquo;s country here.</p>
<p>We began our first day early in the morning, and met at
nine-o&rsquo;clock breakfast in the coffee-room.&nbsp; Egeria
came in glowing.&nbsp; She reminds me of a phrase in a certain
novel, where the heroine is described as always dressing
(seemingly) to suit the season and the sky.&nbsp; Clad in
sea-green linen with a white collar, and belt, she was the very
spirit of a Clovelly morning.&nbsp; She had risen at six, and in
company with Phoebe, daughter of her house (the yellow-haired
lassie mentioned previously), had prowled up and down North Hill,
a transverse place or short street much celebrated by
painters.&nbsp; They had met a certain bold fisher-lad named Jem,
evidently Phoebe&rsquo;s favourite swain, and explored the short
passage where Fish Street is built over, nicknamed Temple
Bar.</p>
<p>Atlas came in shortly after and laid a nosegay at
Egeria&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My humble burnt-offering, your ladyship,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p><i>Tommy</i>: &ldquo;She has lots of offerings, but she
generally prefers to burn &rsquo;em herself.&nbsp; When
Egeria&rsquo;s swains talk about her, it is always &lsquo;<i>ut
vidi</i>,&rsquo; how I saw, succeeded by &lsquo;<i>ut
perii</i>,&rsquo; how I sudden lost my brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Egeria</i>: &ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t indulge in
burnt-offerings&rdquo; (laughing, with slightly heightened
colour); &ldquo;but how you do burn incense!&nbsp; You speak as
if the skeletons of my rejected suitors were hanging on imaginary
lines all over the earth&rsquo;s surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Tommy</i>: &ldquo;They are not hanging on
&lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Jack</i>: &ldquo;Turn your thoughts from
Egeria&rsquo;s victims, you frivolous people, and let me tell you
that I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;up-along&rsquo; this morning and
found&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;a library: a circulating
library maintained by the Clovelly Court people.&nbsp; It is
embowered in roses and jasmine, and there is a bird&rsquo;s nest
hanging just outside one of the open windows next to a shelf of
Dickens and Scott.&nbsp; Never before have young families of
birds been born and brought up with similar advantages.&nbsp; The
snails were in the path just as we saw them yesterday evening,
Atlas; not one has moved, not one has died!&nbsp; Oh, I certainly
must come and live here.&nbsp; The librarian is a dear old lady;
if she ever dies, I am coming to take her place.&nbsp; You will
be postmistress at the Fairy Cross then, Egeria, and we&rsquo;ll
visit each other.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve brought Dickens&rsquo;
&lsquo;Message from the Sea&rsquo; for you, and Kingsley&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Westward Ho!&rsquo; for Tommy, and &lsquo;The Wages of
Sin&rsquo; for Atlas, and &lsquo;Hypatia&rsquo; for Egeria,
&lsquo;Lorna Doone&rsquo; for Jack, and Charles Kingsley&rsquo;s
sermons for myself.&nbsp; We will read aloud every
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tommy succinctly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down by the quay pool, and I&rsquo;ve got
acquainted with a lot of A1 chaps that have agreed to take me
drift-fishing every night, and they are going to put out the
Clovelly lifeboat for exercise this week, and if the weather is
fine, Bill Marks is going to take Atlas and me to Lundy
Island.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t catch me round the evening lamp
very much in Clovelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too slangy, Tommy, and who on earth is
Bill Marks?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our particular friend, Tommy&rsquo;s and
mine,&rdquo; answered Atlas, seeing that Tommy was momentarily
occupied with bacon and eggs.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told us more yarns
than we ever before heard spun in the same length of time.&nbsp;
He is seventy-seven, and says he was a teetotaler until he was
sixty-nine, but has been trying to make up time ever since.&nbsp;
From his condition last evening, I should say he was likely to do
it.&nbsp; He was so mellow, I asked him how he could manage to
walk down the staircase.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I can walk down neat
enough,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when I&rsquo;m in good sailing
trim, as I am now, feeling just good enough, but not too good,
your honour; but when I&rsquo;m half seas over or three sheets in
the wind, I roll down, your honour!&rsquo;&nbsp; He spends three
shillings a week for his food and the same for his
&lsquo;rummidge.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was thrilling when he got on the
subject of the awful wreck just outside this harbour, &lsquo;the
fourth of October, seventy-one years ago, two-and-thirty men
drowned, your honour, and half of &rsquo;em from Clovelly
parish.&nbsp; And I was one of the three men saved in another
storm twenty-four years agone, when two-and-twenty men were
drowned; that&rsquo;s what it means to plough the great salt
field that is never sown, your honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; When he found
we&rsquo;d been in Scotland, he was very anxious to know if we
could talk &lsquo;Garlic,&rsquo; said he&rsquo;d always wanted to
know what it sounded like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow, in the days that followed, Tommy was always with his
particular friends, the fishermen, on the beach, at the Red Lion,
or in the shop of a certain boat-builder, learning the use of the
calking-iron.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Jack, Aunt Celia, and I
unexpectedly found ourselves a quartette for hours together,
while Egeria and Atlas walked in the churchyard, in the beautiful
grounds of Clovelly Court, or in the deer park, where one finds
as perfect a union of marine and woodland scenery as any in
England.</p>
<p>Atlas may have taken her there because he could discuss single
tax more eloquently when he was walking over the entailed estates
of the English landed gentry, but I suspect that single tax had
taken off its hat, and bowing profoundly to Egeria, had said,
&ldquo;After you, Madam!&rdquo; and retired to its proper place
in the universe; for not even the most blatant economist would
affirm that any other problem can be so important as that which
confronts a man when he enters that land of Beulah, which is upon
the borders of Heaven and within sight of the City of Love.</p>
<p>Atlas was young, warm of heart, high of mind, and generous of
soul.&nbsp; All the necessary chords, therefore, were in him,
ready to be set in vibration.&nbsp; No one could do this more
cunningly than Egeria; the only question was whether love would
&ldquo;run out to meet love,&rdquo; as it should, &ldquo;with
open arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We simply waited to see.&nbsp; Mrs. Jack, with that fine lack
of logic that distinguished her, disclaimed all
responsibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is awake, at least,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and that is a great comfort; and now and then he
observes a few very plain facts, mostly relating to Egeria, it is
true.&nbsp; If it does come to anything, I hope he won&rsquo;t
ask her to live in a college settlement the year round, though I
haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt that she would like it.&nbsp;
If there were ever two beings created expressly for each other,
it is these two, and for that reason I have my doubts about the
matter.&nbsp; Almost all marriages are made between two people
who haven&rsquo;t the least thing in common, so far as outsiders
can judge.&nbsp; Egeria and Atlas are almost too well suited for
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The progress of the affair had thus far certainly been
astonishingly rapid, but it might mean nothing.&nbsp;
Egeria&rsquo;s mind and heart were so easy of access up to a
certain point that the traveller sometimes overestimated the
distance covered and the distance still to cover.&nbsp; Atlas
quoted something about her at the end of the very first day, that
described her charmingly: &ldquo;Ordinarily, the sweetest ladies
will make us pass through cold mist and cross a stile or two, or
a broken bridge, before the formalities are cleared away, to
grant us rights of citizenship.&nbsp; She is like those frank
lands where we have not to hand out a passport at the frontier
and wait for dubious inspection.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the description
is incomplete.&nbsp; Egeria, indeed, made no one wait at the
frontier for a dubious inspection of his passport; but once in
the new domain, while he would be cordially welcomed to parks,
gardens, lakes, and pleasure grounds, he would find unexpected
difficulty in entering the queen&rsquo;s private apartments, a
fact that occasioned surprise to some of the travellers.</p>
<p>We all took the greatest interest, too, in the romance of
Phoebe and Jem, for the course of true love did not run at all
smooth for this young couple.&nbsp; Jack wrote a ballad about
her, and Egeria made a tune to it, and sang it to the tinkling,
old-fashioned piano of an evening:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have you e&rsquo;er seen the street of
Clovelly?<br />
The quaint, rambling street of Clovelly,<br />
With its staircase of stone leading down to the sea,<br />
To the harbour so sleepy, so old, and so wee,<br />
The queer, crooked street of Clovelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you e&rsquo;er seen the lass of Clovelly?<br />
The sweet little lass of Clovelly,<br />
With kirtle of grey reaching just to her knee,<br />
And ankles as neat as ankles may be,<br />
The yellow-haired lass of Clovelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good honest lad in Clovelly,<br />
A bold, fisher lad of Clovelly,<br />
With purpose as straight and swagger as free<br />
As the course of his boat when breasting a sea,<br />
The brave sailor lad of Clovelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you e&rsquo;er seen the church at Clovelly?<br />
Have you heard the sweet bells of Clovelly?<br />
The lad and the lassie will hear them, maybe,<br />
And join hand in hand to sail over life&rsquo;s sea<br />
From the little stone church at Clovelly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the nights were cool or damp we crowded into Mrs.
Jack&rsquo;s tiny china-laden sitting-room, and had a blaze in
the grate with a bit of driftwood burning blue and green and
violet on top of the coals.&nbsp; Tommy sometimes smelled of
herring to such a degree that we were obliged to keep the door
open; but his society was so precious that we endured the
odours.</p>
<p>But there were other evenings out of doors, when we sat in a
sheltered corner down on the pier, watching the line of limestone
cliffs running westward to the revolving light at Hartland Point
that sent us alternate flashes of ruby and white across the
water.&nbsp; Clovelly lamps made glittering disks in the quay
pool, shining there side by side with the reflected
star-beams.&nbsp; We could hear the regular swish-swash of the
waves on the rocks, and to the eastward the dripping of a stream
that came tumbling over the cliff.</p>
<p>Such was our last evening in Clovelly; a very quiet one, for
the charm of the place lay upon us and we were loath to leave
it.&nbsp; It was warm and balmy, and the moonlight lay upon the
beach.&nbsp; Egeria leaned against the parapet, the serge of her
dress showing white against the background of rock.&nbsp; The
hood of her dark blue yachting-cape was slipping off her head,
and her eyes were as deep and clear as crystal pools.</p>
<p>Presently she began to sing,&mdash;first, &ldquo;The Sands
o&rsquo; Dee,&rdquo; then,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Three fishers went sailing out into the
west,<br />
Out into the west as the sun went down;<br />
Each thought of the woman who loved him the best,<br />
And the children stood watching them out of the town.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Egeria is one of the few women who can sing well without an
accompaniment.&nbsp; She has a thrilling voice, and what with the
scene, the hour, and the pathos of Kingsley&rsquo;s verses, tears
rushed into my eyes, and Bill Marks&rsquo; words came back to
me&mdash;&ldquo;Two-and-twenty men drowned; that&rsquo;s what it
means to plough the great salt field that is never
sown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atlas gazed at her with eyes that no longer cared to keep
their secret.&nbsp; Mrs. Jack was still uncertain; for me, I was
sure.&nbsp; Love had rushed past him like a galloping horseman,
and shooting an arrow almost without aim, had struck him full in
the heart, that citadel that had withstood a dozen deliberate
sieges.</p>
<p>It was midnight, and our few belongings were packed.&nbsp;
Egeria had come to the Inn to sleep, and stole into my room to
warm her toes before the blaze in my grate, for I was chilly and
had ordered a sixpenny fire.&nbsp; When I say that she came in to
warm her toes, I am asking you to accept her statement, not mine;
it is my opinion that she came in for no other purpose than to
tell me something that was in her mind and heart pleading for
utterance.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t help her by leading up to the subject, because
I thought her fib so flagrant and unnecessary; accordingly, we
talked over a multitude of things,&mdash;Phoebe and Jem and their
hard-hearted parents, our visit to Cardiff and Ilfracombe, Bill
Marks and his wife, the service at the church, and finally her
walk with Atlas in the churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went inside,&rdquo; said Egeria, &ldquo;and I copied
the inscription on the bronze tablet that Atlas liked so much on
Sunday: &lsquo;Her grateful and affectionate husband&rsquo;s last
and proudest wish will be that whenever Divine Providence shall
call him hence, his name may be engraved on the same tablet that
is sacred in perpetuating as much virtue and goodness as could
adorn human nature.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she went on, with
apparent lack of sequence: &ldquo;Penelope, don&rsquo;t you think
it is always perfectly safe to obey a Scriptural command, because
I have done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find it in the Old or the New
Testament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say that if you found some remarks about
breaking the bones of your enemy, and have twisted it out of its
connection, it would be particularly bad advice to
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took out a tortoise-shell dagger just here, and gave her
head an absent-minded shake so that her lustrous coil of hair
uncoiled itself and fell on her shoulders in a ruddy
spiral.&nbsp; It was a sight to induce covetousness, but one
couldn&rsquo;t be envious of Egeria.&nbsp; She charmed one by her
lack of consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The happy lot<br />
Be his to follow<br />
Those threads through lovely curve and hollow,<br />
And muse a lifetime how they got<br />
Into that wild, mysterious knot,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>quoted I, as I gave her head an insinuating pat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, Egeria, stand and deliver!&nbsp; What is the
Scriptural command, that having first obeyed, you ask my advice
about afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might not think it, but I have, and it is here on
my table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am going into my room, to lock the door, and
call the verse through the keyhole.&nbsp; But you must promise
not to say a word to me till to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not in a position to dictate terms, so I promised.&nbsp;
The door closed, the bolt shot into the socket, and
Egeria&rsquo;s voice came so faintly through the keyhole that I
had to stoop to catch the words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuteronomy, 10:19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I flew to my Bible.&nbsp;
Genesis&mdash;Exodus&mdash;Leviticus&mdash;Numbers&mdash;Deuteronomy&mdash;Deut-er-on-omy&mdash;Ten&mdash;Nineteen&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Love ye therefore the stranger</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

To find the sit-fast acres where you left them.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Beresford
Broadacres</span>,<br />
<i>April</i> 15, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Penelope</span>, in the old sense, is no
more!&nbsp; No mound of grass and daisies covers her; no shaft of
granite or marble marks the place where she rests;&mdash;as a
matter of fact she never does rest; she walks and runs and sits
and stands, but her travelling days are over.&nbsp; For the
present, in a word, the reason that she is no longer
&ldquo;Penelope,&rdquo; with dozens of portraits and three
volumes of &ldquo;Experiences&rdquo; to her credit, is, that she
is Mrs. William Hunt Beresford.</p>
<p>As for Himself, he is just as much William Hunt Beresford as
ever he was, for marriage has not staled, nor fatherhood
withered, his infinite variety.&nbsp; There may be, indeed, a
difference, ever so slight; a new dignity, and an air of
responsibility that harmonizes well with the inch of added girth
at his waist-line and the grey thread or two that becomingly
sprinkle his dark hair.</p>
<p>And where is Herself, the vanished Penelope, you ask; the
companion of Salemina and Francesca; the traveller in England,
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales; the wanderer in Switzerland and
Italy?&nbsp; Well, if she is a thought less irresponsible, merry,
and loquacious, she is happier and wiser.&nbsp; If her easel and
her palette are not in daily evidence, neither are they
altogether banished from the scene; and whatever measure of
cunning Penelope&rsquo;s hand possessed in other days, Mrs.
Beresford has contrived to preserve.</p>
<p>If she wields the duster occasionally, in alternation with the
paint-brush and the pen, she has now a new choice of weapons; and
as for models,&mdash;her friends, her neighbours, even her
enemies and rivals, might admire her ingenuity, her thrift, and
her positive genius in selecting types to paint!&nbsp; She never
did paint anything beautifully but children, though her
backgrounds have been praised, also the various young things that
were a vital part of every composition.&nbsp; She could never
draw a horse or a cow or an ox to her satisfaction, but a
long-legged colt, or a newborn Bossy-calf were well within her
powers.&nbsp; Her puppies and kittens and chickens and goslings
were always admired by the public, and the fact that the mothers
and fathers in the respective groups were never quite as
convincing as their offspring,&mdash;this somehow escaped the
notice of the critics.</p>
<p>Very well, then, what was Penelope inspired to do when she
became Mrs. Beresford and left the Atlantic rolling between the
beloved Salemina, Francesca, and herself?&nbsp; Why, having
&ldquo;crossed the sea and back&rdquo; repeatedly, she found
&ldquo;the sit-fast acres&rdquo; of the house of Beresford where
she &ldquo;left them&rdquo; and where they had been sitting fast
for more than a hundred years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the proper place for us to live,&rdquo; she
said to Himself, when they first viewed the dear delightful New
England landscape over together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is where your
long roots are, and as my roots have been in half a hundred
places they can be easily transplanted.&nbsp; You have a decent
income to begin on; why not eke it out with apples and hay and
corn and Jersey cows and Plymouth Rock cocks and hens, while I
use the scenery for my pictures?&nbsp; There are backgrounds here
for a thousand canvases, all within a mile of your ancestral
doorstep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will do for models in this
remote place,&rdquo; said Himself, putting his hands in his
pockets and gazing dubiously at the abandoned farm-houses on the
hillsides; the still green dooryards on the village street where
no children were playing, and the quiet little brick school-house
at the turn of the road, from which a dozen half-grown boys and
girls issued decorously, looking at us like scared rabbits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea about models,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Beresford.</p>
<p>And it turned out that she had, for all that was ten years
ago, and Penelope the Painter, merged in Mrs. Beresford the
mother, has the three loveliest models in all the
countryside!</p>
<p>Children, of course, are common enough everywhere; not,
perhaps, as common as they should be, but there are a good many
clean, well-behaved, truthful, decently-featured little boys and
girls who will, in course of time, become the bulwarks of the
Republic, who are of no use as models.&nbsp; The public is not
interested in, and will neither purchase nor hang on its walls
anything but a winsome child, a beautiful child, a pathetic
child, or a picturesquely ragged and dirty child.&nbsp; (The
latter type is preferably a foreigner, as dirty American children
are for some reason or other quite unsalable.)</p>
<p>All this is in explanation of the foregoing remarks about Mrs.
Beresford&rsquo;s ingenuity, thrift, and genius in selecting
types to paint.&nbsp; The ingenuity lay in the idea itself; the
thrift, in securing models that should belong to the Beresford
&ldquo;sit-fast acres&rdquo; and not have to be searched for and
&ldquo;hired in&rdquo; by the day; and the genius, in producing
nothing but enchanting, engrossing, adorable, eminently
&ldquo;paintable&rdquo; children.&nbsp; They are just as
obedient, interesting, grammatical, and virtuous as other
people&rsquo;s offspring, yet they are so beautiful that it would
be the height of selfishness not to let the world see them and
turn green with envy.</p>
<p>When viewed by the casual public in a gallery, nobody of
course believes that they are real until some kind friend says:
&ldquo;No, oh, no! not ideal heads at all; perfect likenesses;
the children of Mr. and Mrs. Beresford; Penelope Hamilton, whose
signature you see in the corner, <i>is</i> Mrs.
Beresford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they are exhibited in the guise of, and under such titles
as: &ldquo;Young April,&rdquo; &ldquo;In May Time,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Girl with Chickens,&rdquo; &ldquo;Three of a Kind&rdquo;
(Billy with a kitten and a puppy tumbling over him),
&ldquo;Little Mothers&rdquo; (Frances and Sally with their
dolls), &ldquo;When all the World is Young&rdquo; (Billy,
Frances, and Sally under the trees surrounded by a riot of young
feathered things, with a lamb and a Jersey calf peeping over a
fence in the background), then Himself stealthily visits the
gallery.&nbsp; He stands somewhere near the pictures pulling his
moustache nervously and listening to the comments of the
bystanders.&nbsp; Not a word of his identity or paternity does he
vouchsafe, but occasionally some acquaintance happens to draw
near, perhaps to compliment or congratulate him.&nbsp; Then he
has been heard to say vaingloriously: &ldquo;Oh, no! they are not
flattered; rather the reverse.&nbsp; My wife has an extraordinary
faculty of catching likenesses, and of course she has a wonderful
talent, but she agrees with me that she never quite succeeds in
doing the children justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we are, then, Himself and I, growing old with the country
that gave us birth (God bless it!) and our children growing up
with it, as they always should; for it must have occurred to the
reader that I am Penelope, Hamilton that was, and also, and above
all, that I am Mrs. William Hunt Beresford.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>April</i> 20, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p>Himself and I have gone through the inevitable changes that
life and love, marriage and parenthood, bring to all human
creatures; but no one of the dear old group of friends has so
developed as Francesca.&nbsp; Her last letter, posted in Scotland
and delivered here seven days later, is like a breath of the
purple heather and brings her vividly to mind.</p>
<p>In the old days when we first met she was gay, irresponsible,
vivacious, and a decided flirt,&mdash;with symptoms of becoming a
coquette.&nbsp; She was capricious and exacting; she had far too
large an income for a young girl accountable to nobody; she was
lovely to look upon, a product of cities and a trifle
spoiled.</p>
<p>She danced through Europe with Salemina and me, taking in no
more information than she could help, but charming everybody that
she met.&nbsp; She was only fairly well educated, and such
knowledge as she possessed was vague, uncertain, and never ready
for instant use.&nbsp; In literature she knew Shakespeare,
Balzac, Thackeray, Hawthorne, and Longfellow, but if you had
asked her to place Homer, Schiller, Dante, Victor Hugo, James
Fenimore Cooper, or Thoreau she couldn&rsquo;t have done it
within a hundred years.</p>
<p>In history she had a bowing acquaintance with Napoleon,
Washington, Wellington, Prince Charlie, Henry of Navarre, Paul
Revere, and Stonewall Jackson, but as these gallant gentlemen
stand on the printed page, so they stood shoulder to shoulder,
elbowing one another in her pretty head, made prettier by a
wealth of hair, Marcel-waved twice a week.</p>
<p>These facts were brought out once in examination, by one of
Francesca&rsquo;s earliest lovers, who, at Salemina&rsquo;s
request and my own, acted as her tutor during the spring before
our first trip abroad, the general idea being to prepare her mind
for foreign travel.</p>
<p>I suppose we were older and should have known better than to
allow any man under sixty to tutor Francesca in the spring.&nbsp;
Anyhow, the season worked its maddest pranks on the
pedagogue.&nbsp; He fell in love with his pupil within a few
days,&mdash;they were warm, delicious, budding days, for it was a
very early, verdant, intoxicating spring that produced an unusual
crop of romances in our vicinity.&nbsp; Unfortunately the tutor
was a scholar at heart, as well as a potential lover, and he
interested himself in making psychological investigations of
Francesca&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; She was perfectly willing, for she
always regarded her ignorance as a huge joke, instead of viewing
it with shame and embarrassment.&nbsp; What was more natural,
when she drove, rode, walked, sailed, danced, and &ldquo;sat
out&rdquo; to her heart&rsquo;s content, while more learned young
ladies stayed within doors and went to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock
with no vanity-provoking memories to lull them to sleep?&nbsp;
The fact that she might not be positive as to whether Dante or
Milton wrote &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; or Palestrina antedated
Berlioz, or the Mississippi River ran north and south or east and
west,&mdash;these trifling uncertainties had never cost her an
offer of marriage or the love of a girl friend; so she was
perfectly frank and offered no opposition to the investigations
of the unhappy but conscientious tutor, meeting his questions
with the frankness of a child.&nbsp; Her attitude of mind was the
more candid because she suspected the passion of the teacher and
knew of no surer way to cure him than to let him know her mind
for what it was.</p>
<p>When the staggering record of her ignorance on seven subjects
was set down in a green-covered blank book, she awaited the
result not only with resignation, but with positive hope; a hope
that proved to be ill-founded, for curiously enough the tutor was
still in love with her.&nbsp; Salemina was surprised, but I was
not.&nbsp; Of course I had to know anatomy in order to paint, but
there is more in it than that.&nbsp; In painting the outsides of
people I assure you that I learned to guess more of what was
inside them than their bony structures!&nbsp; I sketched the
tutor while he was examining Francesca and I knew that there were
no abysmal depths of ignorance that could appall him where she
was concerned.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t explain the situation at
all, himself.&nbsp; If there was anything that he admired and
respected in woman, it was a well-stored, logical mind, and three
months&rsquo; tutoring of Francesca had shown him that her mental
machinery was of an obsolete pattern and that it was not even in
good working order.&nbsp; He could not believe himself influenced
(so he confessed to me) by such trivial things as curling lashes,
pink ears, waving hair (he had never heard of Marcel), or mere
beauties of colour and line and form.&nbsp; He said he was not so
sure about Francesca&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Eyes like hers, he
remarked in confidence, were not beneath the notice of any man,
be he President of Harvard University or Master of Balliol
College, for they seemed to promise something never once revealed
in the green examination book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; I answered him; &ldquo;the
green book is not all there is of Miss Monroe, but whatever there
is is plainly not for you&rdquo;; and he humbly agreed with my
dictum.</p>
<p>Is it not strange that a man will talk to one woman about the
charms of another for days upon days without ever realizing that
she may possibly be born for some other purpose than listening to
him?&nbsp; For an hour or two, of course, any sympathetic or
generous-minded person can be interested in the confidences of a
lover; but at the end of weeks or months, during which time he
has never once regarded his listener as a human being of the
feminine gender, with eyes, nose, and hair in no way inferior to
those of his beloved,&mdash;at the end of that time he should be
shaken, smitten, waked from his dreams, and told in ringing tones
that in a tolerably large universe there are probably two women
worth looking at, the one about whom he is talking, and the one
to whom he is talking!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 12, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p>To go on about Francesca, she always had a quick intelligence,
a sense of humour, a heart, and a conscience; four things not to
be despised in the equipment of a woman.&nbsp; The wit she used
lavishly for the delight of the world at large; the heart had not
(in the tutor&rsquo;s time) found anything or anybody on which to
spend itself; the conscience certainly was not working overtime
at the same period, but I always knew that it was there and would
be an excellent reliable organ when once aroused.</p>
<p>Of course there is no reason why the Reverend Ronald
MacDonald, of the Established Church of Scotland, should have
been the instrument chosen to set all the wheels of
Francesca&rsquo;s being in motion, but so it was; and a great
clatter and confusion they made in our Edinburgh household when
the machinery started!&nbsp; If Ronald was handsome he was also a
splendid fellow; if he was a preacher he was also a man; and no
member of the laity could have been more ardently and
satisfactorily in love than he.&nbsp; It was the ardour that
worked the miracle; and when Francesca was once warmed through to
the core, she began to grow.&nbsp; Her modest fortune helped
things a little at the beginning of their married life, for it
not only made existence easier, but enabled them to be of more
service in the straggling, struggling country parishes where they
found themselves at first.</p>
<p>Francesca&rsquo;s beautiful American clothes shocked
Ronald&rsquo;s congregations now and then, and it was felt that,
though possible, it was not very probable, that the grace of God
could live with such hats and shoes, such gloves and jewels as
hers.&nbsp; But by the time Ronald was called from his
Argyllshire church to St. Giles&rsquo;s Cathedral in Edinburgh
there was a better understanding of young Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s
raiment and its relation to natural and revealed religion.&nbsp;
It appeared now that a clergyman&rsquo;s wife, by strict
attention to parochial duties; by being the mother of three
children all perfectly well behaved in church; by subscribing
generously to all worthy charities; by never conducting herself
as light-mindedly as her eyes and conversation seemed to
portend,&mdash;it appeared that a woman <i>could</i> live down
her clothes!&nbsp; It was a Bishop, I think, who argued in
Francesca&rsquo;s behalf that godliness did not necessarily dwell
in frieze and stout leather and that it might flourish in lace
and chiffon.&nbsp; Salemina and I used to call Ronald and
Francesca the antinomic pair.&nbsp; Antinomics, one finds by
consulting the authorities, are apparently contradictory poles,
which, however, do not really contradict, but are only
correlatives, the existence of one making the existence of the
other necessary, explaining each other and giving each other a
real standing and equilibrium.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 7, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p>What immeasurable leagues of distance lie between Salemina,
Francesca, and me!&nbsp; Not only leagues of space divide us, but
the difference in environment, circumstances, and
responsibilities that give reality to space; yet we have bridged
the gulf successfully by a particular sort of three-sided
correspondence, almost impersonal enough to be published, yet
revealing all the little details of daily life one to the
other.</p>
<p>When we three found that we should be inevitably separated for
some years, we adopted the habit of a &ldquo;loose-leaf
diary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pages are perforated with large circular
holes and put together in such a way that one can remove any leaf
without injuring the book.&nbsp; We write down, as the spirit
moves us, the more interesting happenings of the day, and once in
a fortnight, perhaps, we slip a half-dozen selected pages into an
envelope and the packet starts on its round between America,
Scotland, and Ireland.&nbsp; In this way we have kept up with
each other without any apparent severing of intimate friendship,
and a farmhouse in New England, a manse in Scotland, and the
Irish home of a Trinity College professor and his lady are
brought into frequent contact.</p>
<p>Inspired by Francesca&rsquo;s last budget, full of all sorts
of revealing details of her daily life, I said to Himself at
breakfast: &ldquo;I am not going to paint this morning, nor am I
going to &lsquo;keep house&rsquo;; I propose to write in my
loose-leaf diary, and what is more I propose to write about
marriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I mentioned to Himself the subject I intended to treat,
he looked up in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, I beg of you, Penelope,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you do it the other two will follow
suit.&nbsp; Women cannot discuss marriage without dragging in
husbands, and MacDonald, La Touche, and I won&rsquo;t have a leg
to stand upon.&nbsp; The trouble with these &lsquo;loose
leaves&rsquo; that you three keep for ever in circulation is,
that the cleverer they are the more publicity they get.&nbsp;
Francesca probably reads your screeds at her Christian Endeavour
meetings just as you cull extracts from Salemina&rsquo;s for your
Current Events Club.&nbsp; In a word, the loosened leaf leads to
the loosened tongue, and that&rsquo;s rather epigrammatic for a
farmer at breakfast time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to write about husbands,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;least of all my own, but about marriage as an institution;
the part it plays in the evolution of human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, everything you say about it will reflect
upon me,&rdquo; argued Himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;The only husband a
woman knows is her own husband, and everything she thinks about
marriage is gathered from her own experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your attitude is not only timid, it is positively
cowardly!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are an excellent
husband as husbands go, and I don&rsquo;t consider that I have
retrograded mentally or spiritually during our ten years of life
together.&nbsp; It is true nothing has been said in private or
public about any improvement in me due to your influence, but
perhaps that is because the idea has got about that your head is
easily turned by flattery.&mdash;Anyway, I shall be entirely
impersonal in what I write.&nbsp; I shall say I believe in
marriage because I cannot think of any better arrangement; also
that I believe in marrying men because there is nothing else
<i>to</i> marry.&nbsp; I shall also quote that feminist lecturer
who said that the bitter business of every woman in the world is
to convert a trap into a home.&nbsp; Of course I laughed
inwardly, but my shoulders didn&rsquo;t shake for two minutes as
yours did.&nbsp; They were far more eloquent than any loose leaf
from a diary; for they showed every other man in the audience
that you didn&rsquo;t consider that <i>you</i> had to set any
&lsquo;traps&rsquo; for <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Himself leaned back in his chair and gave way to unbridled
mirth.&nbsp; When he could control his speech, he wiped the tears
from his eyes and said offensively:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t; did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, flinging the tea-cosy at his
head, missing it, and breaking the oleander on the plant-shelf
ten feet distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be unmarried for the world!&rdquo;
said Himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t paint every day,
you know you couldn&rsquo;t; and where could you find anything so
beautiful to paint as your own children unless you painted me;
and it just occurs to me that you never paid me the compliment of
asking me to sit for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t paint men,&rdquo; I objected.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are too massive and rugged and ugly.&nbsp; Their
noses are big and hard and their bones show through everywhere
excepting when they are fat and then they are disgusting.&nbsp;
Their eyes don&rsquo;t shine, their hair is never beautiful, they
have no dimples in their hands and elbows; you can&rsquo;t see
their mouths because of their moustaches, and generally
it&rsquo;s no loss; and their clothes are stiff and conventional
with no colour, nor any flowing lines to paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where you keep your &lsquo;properties,&rsquo;
and I&rsquo;ll make myself a mass of colour and flowing lines if
you&rsquo;ll try me,&rdquo; Himself said meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; I responded amiably.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are very nice, but you are not a costume man, and I shudder to
think what you would make of yourself if I allowed you to visit
my property-room.&nbsp; If I ever have to paint you (not for
pleasure, but as a punishment), you shall wear your everyday
corduroys and I&rsquo;ll surround you with the children; then you
know perfectly well that the public will never notice you at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon I went to my studio built on the top
of the long rambling New England shed and loved what I painted
yesterday so much that I went on with it, finding that I had said
to Himself almost all that I had in mind to say, about marriage
as an institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>June</i> 15, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p>We were finishing luncheon on the veranda with all out of
doors to give us appetite.&nbsp; It was Buttercup Sunday, a
yellow June one that had been preceded by Pussy Willow Sunday,
Dandelion Sunday, Apple Blossom, Wild Iris, and Lilac Sunday, to
be followed by Daisy and Black-Eyed Susan and White Clematis and
Goldenrod and Wild Aster and Autumn Leaf Sundays.</p>
<p>Francie was walking over the green-sward with a bowl and
spoon, just as our Scottish men friends used to do with oat-meal
at breakfast time.&nbsp; The Sally-baby was blowing bubbles in
her milk, and Himself and I were discussing a book lately
received from London.</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw Billy, who had wandered from the table, sitting
on the steps bending over a tiny bird&rsquo;s egg in his open
hand.&nbsp; I knew that he must have taken it from some low-hung
nest, but taken it in innocence, for he looked at it with
solicitude as an object of tender and fragile beauty.&nbsp; He
had never given a thought to the mother&rsquo;s days of patient
brooding, nor that he was robbing the summer world of one
bird&rsquo;s flight and one bird&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the whippoorwills singing last night,
Daddy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, indeed, and long before sunrise this
morning.&nbsp; There must be a new family in our orchard, I
think; but then we have coaxed hundreds of birds our way this
spring by our little houses, our crumbs, and our drinking
dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have never had so many since we came here to
live.&nbsp; Look at that little brown bird flying about in the
tall apple-tree, Francie; she seems to be in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;haps it&rsquo;s Mrs. Smiff&rsquo;s
wenomous cat,&rdquo; exclaimed Francie, running to look for a
particularly voracious animal that lived across the fields, but
had been known to enter our bird-Eden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear this, Daddy; isn&rsquo;t it pretty?&rdquo; I said,
taking up the &ldquo;Life of Dorothy Grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy pricked up his ears, for he can never see a book opened
without running to join the circle, so eager he is not to lose a
precious word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wren sang early this morning&rdquo; (I read
slowly).&nbsp; &ldquo;We talked about it at breakfast and how
many people there were who would not be aware of it; and E. said,
&lsquo;Fancy, if God came in and said: &ldquo;Did you notice my
wren?&rdquo; and they were obliged to say they had not known it
was there!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy rose quietly and stole away behind the trees, returning
in a few moments, empty-handed, to stand by my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does God know how many eggs there are in a bird&rsquo;s
nest, mother?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have so many different ideas about what God sees
and takes note of, that it&rsquo;s hard to say, sonny.&nbsp; Of
course you remember that the Bible says not one sparrow falls to
the ground but He knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother bird can&rsquo;t count her eggs, can she,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Billy, you do ask the hardest questions; ones that
I can never answer by Yes and No!&nbsp; She broods her eggs all
day and all night and never lets them get cold, so she must know,
at any rate, that they are going to <i>be</i> birds, don&rsquo;t
you think?&nbsp; And of course she wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose
one; that&rsquo;s the reason she&rsquo;s so faithful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Billy, after a long pause, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care quite so much about the mother, because
sometimes there are five eggs in a weeny, weeny nest that never
could hold five little ones without their scrunching each other
and being uncomfortable.&nbsp; But if God should come in and say:
&lsquo;Did you take my egg, that was going to be a bird?&rsquo; I
just couldn&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>June</i> 15, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p>Another foreign mail is in and the village postmistress has
sent an impassioned request that I steam off the stamps for her
boy&rsquo;s album, enriched during my residence here by specimens
from eleven different countries. (&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Beresford
beats the Wanderin&rsquo; Jew all holler if so be she&rsquo;s
be&rsquo;n to all them places, an&rsquo; come back
alive!&rdquo;&mdash;so she says to Himself.)&nbsp; Among the
letters there is a budget of loose leaves from Salemina&rsquo;s
diary, Salemina, who is now Mrs. Gerald La Touche, wife of
Professor La Touche, of Trinity College, Dublin, and stepmother
to Jackeen and Broona La Touche.</p>
<p>It is midsummer, College is not in session, and they are at
Rosnaree House, their place in County Meath.</p>
<p>Salemina is the one of our trio who continues to move in grand
society.&nbsp; She it is who dines at the Viceregal Lodge and
Dublin Castle.&nbsp; She it is who goes with her distinguished
husband for week-ends with the Master of the Horse, the Lord
Chancellor, and the Dean of the Chapel Royal.&nbsp; Francesca, it
is true, makes her annual bow to the Lord High Commissioner at
Holyrood Palace and dines there frequently during Assembly Week;
and as Ronald numbers one Duke, two Earls, and several Countesses
and Dowager Countesses in his parish, there are awe-inspiring
visiting cards to be found in the silver salver on her hall
table,&mdash;but Salemina in Ireland literally lives with the
great, of all classes and conditions!&nbsp; She is in the heart
of the Irish Theatre and the Modern Poetry movements,&mdash;and
when she is not hobnobbing with playwrights and poets she is
consorting with the Irish nobility and gentry.</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking that she would still be Miss Peabody,
of Salem, Massachusetts, had it not been for my generous and
helpful offices, and those of Francesca!&nbsp; Never were two
lovers, parted in youth in America and miraculously reunited in
middle age in Ireland, more recalcitrant in declaring their
mutual affection than Dr. La Touche and Salemina!&nbsp; Nothing
in the world divided them but imaginary barriers.&nbsp; He was
not rich, but he had a comfortable salary and a dignified and
honourable position among men.&nbsp; He had two children, but
they were charming, and therefore so much to the good.&nbsp;
Salemina was absolutely &ldquo;foot loose&rdquo; and tied down to
no duties in America, so no one could blame her for marrying an
Irishman.&nbsp; She had never loved any one else, and Dr. La
Touche might have had that information for the asking; but he was
such a bat for blindness, adder for deafness, and lamb for
meekness that because she refused him once, when she was the only
comfort of an aged mother and father, he concluded that she would
refuse him again, though she was now alone in the world.&nbsp;
His late wife, a poor, flighty, frivolous invalid, the kind of
woman who always entangles a sad, vague, absent-minded scholar,
had died six years before, and never were there two children so
in need of a mother as Jackeen and Broona, a couple of
affectionate, hot-headed, bewitching, ragged, tousled Irish
darlings.&nbsp; I would cheerfully have married Dr. Gerald
myself, just for the sake of his neglected babies, but I dislike
changes and I had already espoused Himself.</p>
<p>However, a summer in Ireland, undertaken with no such great
stakes in mind as Salemina&rsquo;s marriage, made possible a
chance meeting of the two old friends.&nbsp; This was followed by
several others, devised by us with incendiary motives, and
without Salemina&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; There was also the
unconscious plea of the children working a daily spell; there was
the past, with its memories, tugging at both their hearts; and
above all there was a steady, dogged, copious stream of mental
suggestion emanating from Francesca and me, so that, in course of
time, our middle-aged couple did succeed in confessing to each
other that a separate future was impossible for them.</p>
<p>They never would have encountered each other had it not been
for us; never, never would have become engaged; and as for the
wedding, we forcibly led them to the altar, saying that we must
leave Ireland and the ceremony could not be delayed.</p>
<p>Not that we are the recipients of any gratitude for all
this!&nbsp; Rather the reverse!&nbsp; They constantly allude to
their marriage as made in Heaven, although there probably never
was another union where creatures of earth so toiled and slaved
to assist the celestial powers.</p>
<p>I wonder why middle-aged and elderly lovers make such an
appeal to me!&nbsp; Is it because I have lived much in New
England, where &ldquo;ladies-in-waiting&rdquo; are all too
common,&mdash;where the wistful bride-groom has an invalid mother
to support, or a barren farm out of which he cannot wring a
living, or a malignant father who cherishes a bitter grudge
against his son&rsquo;s chosen bride and all her
kindred,&mdash;where the woman herself is compassed about with
obstacles, dragging out a pinched and colourless existence year
after year?</p>
<p>And when at length the two waiting ones succeed in triumphing
over circumstances, they often come together wearily, soberly,
with half the joy pressed out of life.&nbsp; Young lovers have no
fears!&nbsp; That the future holds any terrors, difficulties,
bugbears of any sort they never seem to imagine, and so they are
delightful and amusing to watch in their gay and sometimes
irresponsible and selfish courtships; but they never tug at my
heart-strings as their elders do, when the great, the
long-delayed moment comes.</p>
<p>Francesca and I, in common with Salemina&rsquo;s other
friends, thought that she would never marry.&nbsp; She had been
asked often enough in her youth, but she was not the sort of
woman who falls in love at forty.&nbsp; What we did not know was
that she had fallen in love with Gerald La Touche at
five-and-twenty and had never fallen out,&mdash;keeping her
feelings to herself during the years that he was espoused to
another, very unsuitable lady.&nbsp; Our own sentimental
experiences, however, had sharpened our eyes, and we divined at
once that Dr. La Touche, a scholar of fifty, shy, reserved,
self-distrustful, and oh! so in need of anchor and
harbour,&mdash;that he was the only husband in the world for
Salemina; and that he, after giving all that he had and was to an
unappreciative woman, would be unspeakably blessed in the wife of
our choosing.</p>
<p>I remember so well something that he said to me once as we sat
at twilight on the bank of the lake near Devorgilla.&nbsp; The
others were rowing toward us bringing the baskets for a tea
picnic, and we, who had come in the first boat, were talking
quietly together about intimate things.&nbsp; He told me that a
frail old scholar, a brother professor, used to go back from the
college to his house every night bowed down with weariness and
pain and care, and that he used to say to his wife as he sank
into his seat by the fire: &ldquo;Oh! praise me, my wife, praise
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eyes filled and I turned away to hide the tears when Dr.
Gerald continued absently: &ldquo;As for me, Mistress Beresford,
when I go home at night I take my only companion from the
mantelshelf and leaning back in my old armchair say,
&lsquo;Praise me, my pipe, praise me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Salemina Peabody was in the boat coming toward us, looking
as serenely lovely in a grey tweed and broad white hat as any
good sweet woman of forty could look, while he gazed at her
&ldquo;through a glass darkly&rdquo; as if she were practically
non-existent, or had nothing whatever to do with the case.</p>
<p>I concealed rebellious opinions of blind bats, deaf adders,
meek lambs, and obstinate pigs, but said very gently and
impersonally: &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t always allow your
pipe to be your only companion;&mdash;you, with your children,
your name and position, your home and yourself to give&mdash;to
somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he only answered: &ldquo;You exaggerate, my dear madam;
there is not enough left in me or of me to offer to any
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I could do nothing but make his tea graciously and hand it
to him, wondering that he was able to see the cup or the
bread-and-butter sandwich that I put into his modest, ungrateful
hand.</p>
<p>However, it is all a thing of the past, that dim, sweet, grey
romance that had its rightful background in a country of subdued
colourings, of pensive sweetness, of gentle greenery, where there
is an eternal wistfulness in the face of the natural world,
speaking of the springs of hidden tears.</p>
<p>Their union is a perfect success, and I echo the Boots of the
inn at Devorgilla when he said: &ldquo;An&rsquo; sure it&rsquo;s
the doctor that&rsquo;s the satisfied man an&rsquo; the luck is
on him as well as on e&rsquo;er a man alive!&nbsp; As for her
ladyship, she&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the blessings o&rsquo; the
wurruld an&rsquo; &rsquo;t would be an o&rsquo;jus pity to spile
two houses wid &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>July</i> 12, 19&ndash;.</p>
<p>We were all out in the orchard sunning ourselves on the little
haycocks that the &ldquo;hired man&rdquo; had piled up here and
there under the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not really so beautiful as Italy,&rdquo; I said
to Himself, gazing up at the newly set fruit on the apple boughs
and then across the close-cut hay field to the level pasture,
with its rocks and cow paths, its blueberry bushes and sweet
fern, its clumps of young sumachs, till my eyes fell upon the
deep green of the distant pines.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
to say it, because it seems disloyal, but I almost believe I
think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not as picturesque,&rdquo; Himself agreed
grudgingly, his eye following mine from point to point;
&ldquo;and why do we love it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing delicious and luxuriant about
it,&rdquo; I went on critically, &ldquo;yet it has a delicate,
ethereal, austere, straight-forward Puritanical loveliness of its
own; but, no, it is not as beautiful as Italy or Ireland, and it
isn&rsquo;t as tidy as England.&nbsp; If you keep away from the
big manufacturing towns and their outskirts you may go by motor
or railway through shire after shire in England and never see
anything unkempt, down-at-the-heel, out-at-elbows, or
ill-cared-for; no broken-down fences or stone walls; no heaps of
rubbish or felled trees by the wayside; no unpainted or tottering
buildings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see plenty of ruins,&rdquo; interrupted Himself in
a tone that promised argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but ruins are different; they are finished; they
are not tottering, they <i>have</i> tottered!&nbsp; Our country
is too big, I suppose, to be &lsquo;tidy,&rsquo; but how I should
like to take just one of the United States and clear it up, back
yards and all, from border line to border line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking like a housewife now, not like an
artist,&rdquo; said Himself reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am both, I hope, and I don&rsquo;t intend that
any one shall know where the one begins or the other leaves off,
either!&nbsp; And if any foreigner should remark that America is
unfinished or untidy I shall deny it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie!&nbsp; Penelope!&nbsp; You who used to be a citizen
of the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am still, so far as a roving foot and a knowledge
of three languages can make me; but you remember that the soul
&lsquo;retains the characteristic of its race and the heart is
true to its own country, even to its own
parish.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we be going to the other countries,
mother?&rdquo; asked Billy.&nbsp; &ldquo;When shall we see our
aunt in Scotland and our aunt in Ireland?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Poor
lambs!&nbsp; Since the death of their Grandmother Beresford they
do not possess a real relation in the world!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be very long, Billy,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to go until we can leave the
perambulator behind.&nbsp; The Sally-baby toddles now, but she
must be able to walk on the English downs and the Highland
heather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Irish bogs,&rdquo; interpolated Billy, who has
a fancy for detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Irish bogs are not always easy
travelling,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but the Sally-baby will
soon be old enough to feel the spring of the Irish turf under her
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the chickens and ducklings and pigeons do
while we are gone?&rdquo; asked Francie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; the lammies?&rdquo; piped the Sally-baby, who
has all the qualities of Mary in the immortal lyric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we won&rsquo;t leave home until the spring has come
and all the young things are born.&nbsp; The grass will be green,
the dandelions will have their puff-balls on, the apple blossoms
will be over, and Daddy will get a kind man to take care of
everything for us.&nbsp; It will be May time and we will sail in
a big ship over to the aunts and uncles in Scotland and Ireland
and I shall show them my children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall play &lsquo;hide-and-go-coop&rsquo; with
their children,&rdquo; interrupted Francie joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will never have heard of that game, but you will
all play together!&rdquo;&nbsp; And here I leaned back on the
warm haycock and blinked my eyes a bit in moist anticipation of
happiness to come.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be eight-year-old
Ronald MacDonald to climb and ride and sail with our Billy; and
there will be little Penelope who is named for me, and will be
Francie&rsquo;s playmate; and the new little boy
baby&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proba&rsquo;ly Aunt Francie&rsquo;s new boy baby will
grow up and marry our girl one,&rdquo; suggested Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has my consent to the alliance in advance,&rdquo;
said Himself, &ldquo;but I dare say your mother has arranged it
all in her own mind and my advice will not be needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not arranged anything,&rdquo; I retorted;
&ldquo;or if I have it was nothing more than a thought of young
Ronald or Jack La Touche in&mdash;another
quarter,&rdquo;&mdash;this with discreetly veiled emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is another quarter, mother?&rdquo; inquired
Francie, whose mental agility is somewhat embarrassing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why,&mdash;well,&mdash;it is any other place than
the one you are talking about.&nbsp; Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so very well, but p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I will in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope springs eternal!&rdquo; quoted Francie&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, as I was saying before being interrupted by
the entire family, we will go and visit the Irish cousins,
Jackeen and Broona, who belong to Aunt Salemina and Uncle Gerald,
and the Sally-baby will be the centre of attraction because she
is her Aunt Salemina&rsquo;s godchild&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are all God&rsquo;s children,&rdquo; insisted
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between a god-child and a
God&rsquo;s child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bottle of chloroform is in the medicine closet, my
poor dear; shall I run and get it?&rdquo; murmured Himself
<i>sotto voce</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every child is a child of God,&rdquo; I began
helplessly, &ldquo;and when she is somebody&rsquo;s godchild
she&mdash;oh! lend me your handkerchief, Billy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the nose-bleed, mother?&rdquo; he asked, bending
over me solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oh, no! it&rsquo;s nothing at all, dear.&nbsp;
Perhaps the hay was going to make me sneeze.&nbsp; What was I
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the god&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; I remember!&nbsp;
(<i>Ka-choo</i>!)&nbsp; We will take the Irish cousins and the
Scotch cousins and go all together to see the Tower of London and
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go to Bushey Park and see
the chestnuts in bloom, and will dine at Number 10, Dovermarle
Street&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not go there, Billy,&rdquo; said Himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was at Number 10, Dovermarle Street that your mother
told me she wouldn&rsquo;t marry me; or at least that she&rsquo;d
have to do a lot of thinking before she&rsquo;d say Yes; so she
left London and went to North Malvern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t she think in London?&rdquo;&nbsp; (This
was Billy.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she always want to be married to
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; (This was Francie.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she like <i>us</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Still
Francie.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never mentioned,&mdash;not one of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems rather queer!&rdquo; remarked Billy, giving
me a reproachful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll leave the Irish and Scotch uncles and
aunts behind and go to North Malvern just by ourselves.&nbsp; It
was there that your mother concluded that she <i>would</i> marry
me, and I rather like the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother loves it, too; she talks to me about it when she
puts me to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Francie again.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; but you&rsquo;ll find your mother&rsquo;s
heart scattered all over the Continent of Europe.&nbsp; One bit
will be clinging to a pink thorn in England; another will be in
the Highlands somewhere,&mdash;wherever the heather&rsquo;s in
bloom; another will be hanging on the Irish gorse bushes where
they are yellowest; and another will be hidden under the seat of
a Venetian gondola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to Daddy&rsquo;s nonsense,
children!&nbsp; He thinks mother throws her heart about
recklessly while he loves only one thing at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four things!&rdquo; expostulated Himself, gallantly
viewing our little group at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strictly speaking, we are not four things, we are only
four parts of one thing;&mdash;counting you in, and I really
suppose you ought to be counted in, we are five parts of one
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we come home again from the other
countries?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, sonny!&nbsp; The little Beresfords must come
back and grow up with their own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a little Beresford, mother?&rdquo; asked Francie,
looking wistfully at her brother as belonging to the superior sex
and the eldest besides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is the Sally-baby one too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Himself laughed unrestrainedly at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you are more than
half mother, with your unexpectednesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love to be more than half mother!&rdquo; cried
Francie, casting herself violently about my neck and imbedding me
in the haycock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear, but pull me up now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
supper-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy picked up the books and the rug and made preparations
for the brief journey to the house.&nbsp; I put my hair in order
and smoothed my skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be supper like ours in the other countries,
mother?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if we go in May time,
when do we come back again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Himself rose from the ground with a luxurious stretch of his
arms, looking with joy and pride at our home fields bathed in the
afternoon midsummer sun.&nbsp; He took the Sally-baby&rsquo;s
outstretched hands and lifted her, crowing, to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help sister over the stubble, my son.&mdash;We&rsquo;ll
come away from the other countries whenever mother says:
&lsquo;Come, children, it&rsquo;s time for
supper.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; I assured
Billy, holding him by one hand and Francie by the other, as we
walked toward the farmhouse.&nbsp; &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t live in
the other countries, because Daddy&rsquo;s &lsquo;sit-fast
acres&rsquo; are here in New England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whenever and wherever we five are together,
especially wherever mother is, it will always be home,&rdquo;
said Himself thankfully, under his breath.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
